With weather systems failing to bring widespread rainfall, the State received 168.4 mm since October 1, a deficit of 62 per cent when compared to the season\u2019s average of 441 mm.\n\nAccording to meteorologists, the situation this year is even worse than 1974 when the State recorded a 60 per cent deficit in rainfall with nearly 176 mm. This year, the rain was interspersed with long, dry spells. Officials of the Meteorological Department said the weather was likely to be dry in the State for the next few days, except for light rain in some areas of coastal south Tamil Nadu on January 1 and 2.\n\nS.B.

The reasons for the failure of the monsoon would be analysed during a review meeting in a couple of weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nWeather experts noted that the State had experienced a drought in 1974 and 1938. A drought has not been officially declared this year.\n\nThe Meteorological Department has predicted that Chennai will experience a partly cloudy sky and the night temperature will be around 22 degree Celsius during the weekend. However, Chennai was better in terms of rainfall this monsoon compared to the rest of the State, they said.\n\nY.E.A. Raj, former deputy director general of meteorology, said a shortfall in rainfall up to 20 per cent was considered normal for the season. \u201cTamil Nadu has experienced poor rainfall wherein there was a deficit of 30-40 per cent during many years in 1980s. The State has had poor rainfall with a shortfall of more than 30 per cent for 17 years during this century,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Chennai\u2019s annual rainfall crossed 1,000 mm this year. Though the water bodies are nearly dry and a drought-like situation persists, a good southwest monsoon boosted the annual rainfall.\n\nMeanwhile, weather blogger K. Srikanth who runs the blog \u2018Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikalam\u2019 noted that Tamil Nadu had recorded the worst rainfall this year after 1876.\n\nThe State has recorded an annual rainfall of 536 mm, making it second worst year of rainfall after 1876 when it recorded 527.4 mm. \u201cNormally, low rainfall during the northeast monsoon also impacts the poor annual rainfall,\u201d he said.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg", "authors": ["K Lakshmi"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article16967061.ece", "title": "Tamil Nadu records its worst monsoon since 1901"}, {"text": "After banning the sale of flavoured chewing tobacco sold in sachets as an alternative to gutka, which is also banned, the State government is now re-examining the ban leaving anti-tobacco activists worried.\n\nHighly placed sources in the Health Department told The Hindu that the department was exploring legal possibilities to amend the November 24 circular, which can weaken the ban.

Early in 2016, Noora and her brother, sister and parents abandoned their home and began a long journey west, crossing the border into Turkey, taking a boat to the Greek island of Lesbos and eventually entering Macedonia.\n\nTheir path was one well-trodden by hundreds of thousands of people escaping war or poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia \u2014 and like many of their fellow travellers, the Arkavazis had set their sights on Germany.\n\nWhile her family continued on their odyssey, Noora stayed put in Macedonia after Cupid\u2019s arrow struck.\n\n\u201cI had a simple dream to live with my family in Germany,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine a big surprise for me here.\u201d\n\nWhen she first met Bobi, Noora had a high fever and was desperate to know if her family could cross the border into Serbia. Balkan countries had just begun closing their doors to migrants, so the fate of those transiting through Macedonia was unclear.\n\nThe other police officers all directed her to Bobi because he spoke good English, and he made sure she and her frail mother were taken care of with medical aid and blankets.\n\nTwice-divorced Bobi says he knew he had found someone special. \u201cWhen I saw Noora for the first time, I saw something good in her eyes.\u201d\n\nHelping hands\n\nNoora, who speaks six languages and began helping the local Red Cross, liked the way the tall policeman would play with the migrants\u2019 children, unlike some of his more serious colleagues.\n\nThe Macedonian force has faced criticism for its treatment of migrants, particularly for firing tear gas at some of those trying to cross the border from Greece.\n\nOne evening in April, Bobi invited Noora to a restaurant, where she recalls him being extremely nervous, drinking lots of water and shaking. Then he suddenly proposed. \u201cI told him no, you\u2019re joking... but maybe ten times he repeated this, \u2018will you marry me?\u2019.\u201d\n\nNoora eventually said yes, but she worried about her parents\u2019 reaction to her marrying a non-Muslim.\n\nShe told them: \u201cI chose a good man for my life and I will marry him.

The united Opposition was expecting that closer to the Assembly elections in the State in the summer of 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will encircle Ms. Banerjee with the chit fund scam investigation, facilitating victory for the Left-Congress combine.\n\nA year later, the Congress is unsure about its future in the State, with party vice-president Rahul Gandhi coordinating anti-demonetisation moves with Ms. Banerjee, while the Left is still counting its mistakes in the State. The BJP, the only party to have made some progress in West Bengal, is expected to grow in 2017.\n\nFor Ms. Banerjee, the first quarter of 2016 was unsettling. The Opposition \u2014 the CPI(M) and Congress \u2014 had stitched a reasonable electoral understanding; the \u2018cash-on-camera scam\u2019 surfaced and an under-construction flyover collapsed in Kolkata, killing many.

The voters backed her in 211 of the seats.\n\nWithin 90 days, Ms. Banerjee ruthlessly cut her detractors to size. The ruling party \u201cnegotiated deals\u201d with members of the non-Trinamool civic bodies to wrest control over panchayats and municipal bodies, ensuring an \u201cOpposition-free\u201d Bengal, mirroring an emerging political trend in the country.\n\nAt least half-a-dozen Opposition MLAs joined the Trinamool and many are in the waiting.\n\nSole power\n\nMs. Banerjee transferred officers whom she disliked, celebrated the victory of the court verdict on land in Singur and made it evident to top bureaucrats, powerful Ministers and influential editors that there was only one one tune in Bengal and she controls its beat.\n\nOnce her complete control was established, the Trinamool chief needed a fresh challenge as she is known for strong resistance against good opposition.

The NHAI plans to provide immediate relief to the developers by covering 90 per cent of the interest cost and operational and maintenance expenses for the period when toll collection was suspended.\n\nHowever, the compensation does not cover the debt repayment obligation.\n\n\u201cThe ICRA believes that the proposed compensation mechanism based on O&M and interest costs, could lead to disputes with developers, given the huge revenue loss for them,\u201d the agency said on December 9.\n\nThe NHAI has classified demonetisation as a political force majeure event, but the ICRA said that in cases where aggregate financial effect exceeded Rs. 1 crore or 0.5 per cent of the net realisable fee in any accounting year, Clause 41 of the concession agreement came into force.\n\n\u201cUnder this, the NHAI is obliged to place the concessionaire in the same financial position as it would have enjoyed had there been no such change in the law. In which case, the clause also provides for cash compensation for revenue loss in order to protect the net present value of the cash flows to the developers,\u201d said ICRA vice-president Shubham Jain.\n\nHowever, demonetisation helped the Indian Railways to exceed its target of passenger bookings for November. The number of passengers rose by seven per cent to 7.09 crore against the Railways\u2019 target of 6.6 crore passengers in November.\n\nAs a result, Railways\u2019 passenger earnings grew 11 per cent to Rs. 3,802 crore in November against a six per cent dip in passenger revenues witnessed in the same month last year. However, freight earnings reduced by 1 per cent to Rs. 9,014 crore.\n\n\u201cWhile demonetisation has helped shore up our passenger revenue, it has impacted our freight earnings as loading of our core products, especially coal and cement, has slowed down,\u201d a Railway Ministry official said.\n\nRobust air traffic\n\nDomestic air traffic growth continued to be robust in November and increased by 22.45 per cent to 89.66 lakh compared to the previous month. In October, the passenger traffic had risen by 23.20 per cent to 86.72 lakh.\n\nGlobal aviation consultant CAPA said traffic growth remained strong in December, and, although there was \u201cno visible impact\u201d as yet of demonetisation, growth may be impacted in the next financial year.\n\n\u201cThe next financial year is expected to be the third consecutive year of domestic growth above 20 per cent. Growth could be as high as 25 per cent but may be tempered 3-5 percentage points lower because of the impact of demonetisation,\u201d CAPA said in its India Aviation Outlook for 2017-18.\n\nBut with collection\n\nof toll suspended for many days, road developers were affected badly", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article16966915.ece/BINARY/30-somesh-NOTES+GJO12H35M.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Somesh Jha"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Rail-air-sectors-ride-note-ban-well/article16966916.ece", "title": "Rail, air sectors ride note ban well"}, {"text": "Society should be vigilant against the attempts to wilfully misinterpret Sree Narayana Guru\u2019s teachings to appropriate him as the representative of a particular caste or religion, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.\n\nHe was speaking after inaugurating the 84th Sivagiri Pilgrimage at the Sivagiri Madom in Varkala here on Friday.\n\nIn a speech replete with extensive references to the Guru\u2019s teachings and writings, Mr. Vijayan said that if the people were not vigilant enough, the Guru would be appropriated and anointed as the Guru of everything that he stood against.\n\n\u201cThe Guru taught us that humanism should be our caste and our creed.

After getting consent from the Conservator of Forests, we will start desilting the dam, he added.\n\nEarlier, farmer Rajendran said that Oddanchatram has been facing acute water crisis owing to poor storage in the Parappalar dam. Moreover, Cauvery drinking water scheme was insufficient to meet the total demand of the block. At present, storage in Parappalar was very less and it was the ideal time to desilt the dam, he pointed out.\n\nMany farmers wanted to restore waterbodies and water sources to improve storage level and recharge the groundwater level.\n\nThe \u2018natham poromboke\u2019 land near Rajavaikal at Thekkanthottam on Kodaikanal-Palani ghat road was encroached and fenced by actor Madhavan. The government, in its reply to a RTI petition, stated that it was a public land. The court too issued directions to remove the encroachment. But the officials concerned have not taken any action till now, said farmers Ganesan and Kamalakannan of Palani. The Collector advised the officials to look in to the issue.\n\nThe height of limited use subways constructed by the Railways near Semmadaipatti and K. Pudukottai was very less. and it should be raised to 17 feet for facilitating vehicle movement to enable farmers to transport agri produces to nearby market, said farmers from Pukukottai.\n\nReacting to farmers\u2019 appeal to provide insurance cover to onion, banana and chillies, Joint Director of Agriculture M.

Looking back, it would certainly be in contention for the title annus horribilis, beginning with the aftermath of unprecedented floods in December 2015, and at curtain call, the State struggling to grapple with the death of a Chief Minister and the resultant political pandemonium.\n\nIn January last, the State was barely recovering from the devastating impact caused by the floods of December 2015, but the events of the year, as they unfolded, brought greater shocks to Tamil Nadu. Undeniably, the biggest of them was the death of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. She was hospitalised on September 22 and stayed at the Apollo Hospitals for 75 days. But, her sudden cardiac arrest when it seemed as if she was recovering, was the single biggest event for the State in 2016. The events that followed are likely to reshape the political profile of the State.\n\nO. Panneerselvam, who had stepped in twice before for Jayalalithaa as Chief Minister, had been reallocated her portfolios when in hospital, and it was but natural that he was nominated Chief Minister by his party after her death, despite the intrigue and secrecy that preceded his anointing.\n\nIt was later, the succession of Jayalalithaa\u2019s close aide V.K. Sasikala to the position of general secretary of the AIADMK that caused a raging storm, with the year ending on speculation about the extent of her ambition.\n\nThe Assembly elections in May saw the victory of the AIADMK over the DMK. Elections 2016 put paid to the idea of a possible third front as an alternative to the two Dravidian parties existed. The People\u2019s Welfare Front, cobbled together by MDMK leader Vaiko and including the VCK, Communist parties and DMDK leader Vijayakant bombed. Reports of rampant corruption caused the postponement of polls to two seats: Thanjavur and Aravakurichi.

He occupied the post till June 1978.\n\nWhen reports of infighting in the AIADMK cropped up, MGR took back the post in October 1986 and went on to hold it till his death in December 1987.\n\nA perusal of materials available with The Hindu archives reveals that at a public meeting in Thirukazhukundram in the present Kancheepuram district to mark the party inception 44 years ago, MGR had said that workers of the party would hereafter elect the party general secretary and the term of the office would be only three years.\n\nV.R. Nedunchezhian, who joined the AIADMK in September 1977 after running the Makkal DMK for five months that year following his resignation from the DMK, was initially made the officiating general secretary and subsequently, the full-fledged general secretary in January 1979.\n\nNedunchezhian had to quit the post in June 1980 after he became Finance Minister.

For sometime, this group was identified as AIADMK (Jayalalithaa).\n\nThe other faction owing allegiance to MGR\u2019s widow Janaki Ramachandran came to be called the AIADMK (Janaki). Rahgavanandam, who was a senior deputy general secretary at the time of the split, became the general secretary in-charge of this faction.\n\nAfter the two factions suffered heavy reverses in the January 1989 Assembly elections, they came together and became the unified AIADMK. The party symbol of \u201ctwo leaves,\u201d which was suspended following the split, was also restored to the party in February 1989.

From Vadavalli in the west to Ondipudur in the east the story is the same, they add.\n\nInquiries with those familiar with the issue reveal that the contractors are unable to maintain the street lights because the Coimbatore Corporation had not paid them for long. The amount varies from Rs. 40 lakh to Rs. 45 lakh to nearly Rs. 1 crore for contractors. And it has been pending for six to nine months now.\n\nThe sources say that because the Corporation has not paid the contractors, they are unable to buy spare parts as they have exhausted their credit limit with suppliers and were borrowing to pay weekly wages to workers. The contractors\u2019 reliance on workers has increased because they are the ones who switch on and off the street lights as the automated system has been given a go-by.\n\nContractors say they are overstretched and can do very little other than doing the bare minimum. They expected the Corporation to pay them after its revenue collection increased post demonetisation, but that has not happened. Corporation officials said that the civic body was in the process of clearing the contractors\u2019 dues. But in some cases it had deliberately held back payments following complaints of poor maintenance. Once the contractors improve the quality of service and replace faulty lights, the Corporation will release the remaining money.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article16967115.ece/BINARY/30deccbemkhi5.s+GBU12GUPA.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Karthik Madhavan"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Poor-street-light-maintenance-casts-shadow-on-Corporation/article16967116.ece", "title": "Poor street light maintenance casts shadow on Corporation"}, {"text": "Negamam police have rescued an eight-year-old boy who was allegedly kidnapped by his father\u2019s colleague for ransom and taken to Usilampatti.\n\nAccording to the police, cotton mill worker Selvan lodged a complaint on Wednesday that his son Manoj, who went to a salon, did not return home.

For instance, if you were to describe the plot of the film in one line, it is pretty commonplace: a college student\u2019s journey of finding himself amidst his tryst with friendship and love.\n\nBut the beauty of Kirik Party is how well it narrates this story. In other words, it is the \u2018experience\u2019 that the film creates that counts, and after a while, it hardly matters that you can indeed predict portions of the story.\n\nAjaneesh Lokanath\u2019s sound track plays a huge role in this narrative experience. Of course, the music is the important bit in a musical but his collection of songs not just takes the narrative forward but swathes it in a nostalgic, \u2018feel good\u2019 mood.\n\nThe film opens with a song and we are introduced to Karna (Rakshit Shetty) and his group of really close-knit friends. We are then also told that they are all collectively in love with Sanvi (Rashmika Mandanna).\n\nYou know there is a love story between Karna and Sanvi coming up but the film beckons you to spend time in the boys\u2019 hostel, follow them as they plot to woo Sanvi, see them grapple with boring classes and professors and gradually, eases you into the central love story - again through a song.\n\nThe \u2018villain\u2019 in this narrative is destiny. How an act of fate changes Karna forms the rest of the story.\n\nInterestingly, even though this is a common storyline, the writing is fresh and plays a huge role in keeping one engrossed and entertained. The gags, the banter and even the dialogue infuses the narrative with a unique inventiveness that gives the film the status of a modern college film. Kirik Party actually is a good example of how to revisit the college film as a genre, and do it well.\n\nThere is an underlying theme of self-discovery that runs through the film. For Karna, it is prompted by one woman and fulfilled by another. This theme also gives the film a certain universal quality. The film may be set in a college but the questions it poses aren\u2019t entirely about college. After all, is college ever really over?\n\nThere are portions of the film that remind one of films like Alphonse Puthren\u2019s Premam , Cheran\u2019s Autograph and even Raju Hirani\u2019s 3 Idiots . But Kirik Party also forges a strong relationship with its landscape in Malnad and thereby saves it from becoming a generic college film. Karna literally traverses this landscape in search of himself. In this sense, this is Kannada\u2019s own college musical.\n\nRakshit Shetty is impressive as the college-going Karna, who is both impish as well as astute, carefree as well as resolute \u2014 all the same time. Shetty essays this complex character rather well and holds the film together. Rashmika and Samyuktha Hegde perform well. In fact, the film showcases a whole lot of competent performers.\n\nThe cinematography is slick and experimental. Parts of the second half do tend to weigh you down a bit, but Shetty tries his best to keep you hooked. The film also uses a number of clich\u00e9s- the most noticeable is the use of a woman to prompt a young boy\u2019s transformation into a man. But these are pardonable tropes in an otherwise entertaining film.\n\nOne cannot help but marvel at the timing of the release. The film with its search for closure, introspection and nostalgia fits right in with the end of the year season and mood.\n\nARCHANA NATHAN", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/article16967019.ece/BINARY/30bgann-kirikpa+GB912F5D2.5.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Archana Nathan"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/A-party-down-memory-lane/article16967021.ece", "title": "A party down memory lane"}, {"text": "Artists from Trivarna Kala Kendra, Harish Saga, Prasad, Prithvi Poojary, Sushan Hegde, with their sand sculpture wishing the people a Happy New Year,on the Malpe Beach in Udupi on Friday.

He, unfortunately, came in the line of fire when forest guards tried to shoot the tigress.\n\nThough conservationists working in the field say that the incident is a pointer to inept training and practice of the staff in using firearms, they also point out that in Indian situations, it\u2019s more difficult to manage crowds than animals. Sources in the Forest Department told The Hindu that despite repeated appeals, the crowd refused to disperse and the authorities were left with no option but to persist with the operation.\n\nThe National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) guidelines on animal rescue operation is very clear on crowd management being critical for success in such missions.\n\nMob presence\n\nThe rescue team is often hindered by the presence of a mob and are unable to take a decision as they tend to dictate or force an option and the guards give in to pressure. Hence, it is imperative that the area is cordoned off, say wildlife activists. Authorities had a tough time in H.D. Kote some months ago when a herd of elephants strayed from their habitat and were unable to trace their way back due to the unruly mob which pelted stones at the herd.\n\nThe incident also reinforces the escalating man-animal conflict in the region in the absence of protected buffer zones to absorb the increase in animal population.\n\nNagarahole is home to nearly 80 to 100 tigers and experts aver that the ecosystem may have reached its ecological carrying capacity. There were a slew of tiger deaths in both Nagarahole and Bandipur early this year due to territorial infighting, highlighting the increase in carnivore population, some of which may have been ejected to the forest fringes. The region is also known for human-elephant conflict due to habitat degradation and disturbance, though the pachyderm population is stable without a significant increase in their numbers.\n\nNo trace of tigers\n\nAn operation to drive a tiger and its two cubs back into the jungles at Malali village in H.D. Kote concluded on Friday with no trace of the animals. The three animals had found a sanctuary in a banana plantation. On Thursday, efforts to drive them back into the forests at the Antharsanthe range of the park had led to a commotion and the death of a farmer, Murthy.\n\nConservator of Forests S.

As a first step, the Agriculture Department has begun cultivating oranges on a 25-acre plot on its vegetable farm located close to the Parambikulam Tiger Reserve.\n\nDuring the British rule, Nelliampathy oranges had many takers worldwide, including the British royal family. Fresh oranges plucked from Nelliampathy were shipped to England via Kochi harbour.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the vegetable farm controlled by then princely State of Kochi had supplied oranges and other fruits to fighters positioned elsewhere. By 1980, the plantations in Nelliampathy had stopped cultivating oranges largely because of poor patronisation, decrease in demand, and lack of modern cultivation methods.\n\n\u201cWe started orange cultivation last year on a small portion of the farm on an experimental basis. When the result was positive, we suggested the possibility of reintroducing orange cultivation in Nelliampathy to Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar. It was his eagerness that prompted us to begin cultivation this year on a large scale,\u201d said farm superintendent E.K. Yusuf.\n\n4,000 saplings\n\nLast week, 4,000 orange saplings were planted on the 25-acre plot. There was a budgetary allocation of Rs.50 lakh for the purpose. Some good varieties have been planted and they should start giving yield from next year.\n\nMr.Yusuf said cultivation would be extended to more areas in the coming years depending on the yield next year. \u201cSoil moisture and climate are still conducive for orange cultivation. What they require is proper care using modern technology,\u201d said Mr. Yusuf.\n\nPassion fruit now\n\nThough orange cultivation was stopped years ago, the vegetable farm still attracts tourists. Now passion fruit is grown here.\n\nThe fruit and its value-added products are a major hit among tourists.\n\nSpread over 339.12 hectares of land, the farm is a major tourist attraction. It also operates a retail outlet where 91 varieties of fruit-based products, including jams and jellies, are available.\n\nNearly 100 tourists visit the farm daily which is at an altitude of 1,050 m above sea level and receives an average annual rainfall of 3,500 mm.

With large parts of the State facing parched conditions, the government has turned its attention to addressing drinking water shortage. Efforts are on to establish water kiosks in all wards.\n\nWater kiosks in all wards\n\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has estimated a requirement of 10,900 kiosks across the State.\n\nThe government is gearing up to enforce the drought mitigation measures recommended by the KSDMA. Officials said the proposal for a 75 per cent cut in the use of groundwater by industries had not yet been taken seriously. \u201cMost industrial units in the State use groundwater for captive supply. So far, there has not been any serious effort to regulate the use of water. The situation calls for drastic enforcement,\u201d an official said.\n\nThe government is also considering a crackdown on wastage of water, with punitive action as a deterrent. As per the system statistics released by the State Load Despatch Centre, the total water storage in hydro electric reservoirs has come down to 47 per cent on Friday, enough to generate just 1,943 million units of electricity.\n\nLast year, the hydroelectric dams in the State had enough water to generate 2,744 mu, while the situation was better in 2014 (3,206 mu) and 2013 (3,646 mu).\n\nHope in summer rain\n\nAccording to A. Shainamol, Managing Director, Kerala Water Authority, the storage position in reservoirs used for drinking water supply was enough to tide over the situation till March. \u201cEfforts are on the fast track for completion of ongoing water supply schemes and carrying out repairs wherever necessary. The summer rain in April and May are expected to provide some relief,\u201d she said.\n\nThat is something the Groundwater Department is also looking forward to.

A viewer knows what s/he\u2019s in for, from parodies to refurbished comic tracks featuring a long list of comedians who cushion a feeble plot. Intlo Deyyam Nakem Bhayam marks the actor\u2019s foray into horror comedies, adequately tailored to match his strengths. He reprises his typical underdog part, as he plays for a wedding band, chases a girl he spots at a temple and is later forced to be a sorcerer in a haunted mansion.\n\nThe laughs are frequent as the director sets up the premise. Shakalaka Shankar and his Jabardasth counterpart control the proceedings well. The laughs are spontaneous, but you can\u2019t escape their crass undertones. Sample lines like \u2018 padmasanam ante padma tho asanama \u2019. As long as director G. Nageswara Reddy is in familiar territory and sticks to the brand of comedy he\u2019s known for, he does fine. It\u2019s the horror comedy formula that he fails to crack.\n\nThe narrative flows smoothly as he keeps you guessing about the ghost\u2019s past. When he does bring in the twist, all you witness is a formality waiting to be completed. An aggressive ghost with an unfulfilled wish, traversing one body to the other for her interests, sending intermittent danger signals to the male protagonist, is done to death. This film\u2019s terrain feels like an adulterated mix of most horror comedies you\u2019ve watched this year from Kalavathi and Nayaki to Ekkadiki Pothavu Chinnavada . A positive from the movie is its departure from rhyming one liners. Most of the few one liners are weaved into the story with some purpose. When it comes to parodies though, there\u2019s no stopping the director. The actors\u2019 reference lines are from Baahubali, Kabali, Janatha Garage and Nannaku Prematho . The one eliciting maximum laughs is when Allari Naresh utters Mohan Babu\u2019s Pedarayudu lines, \u2018The relationship between a wife and a husband...\u2019\n\nMost performances are loud and perfunctory. One sees Brahmanandam after long and he doesn\u2019t disappoint. Drushyam girl Kruthika deserved better than this outing.

Appatlo Okadundevadu is the story of a cricketer, Railway Raju (Sri Vishnu), who has immense potential but is led into crime and also becomes a victim of circumstances. He is denied a place in the team because his sister and brother-in-law have naxal links. And his past of having killed an extortionist haunts him.\n\nTo make matters worse, an encounter specialist Imtiaz (Nara Rohith) is baying for his blood. Imtiaz has an axe to grind; his parents were killed by the naxals. Two factors lead us to watching the film \u2014 one, Nara Rohith\u2019s recent choice of subjects and second, Sri Vishnu being known as a reasonably good actor. Sadly, the film fails to deliver on the promise.\n\nThe story is about Raju\u2019s life, his passion for a sport, his girlfriend, his family which is eliminated and how he suddenly becomes rich and powerful. On the other hand, we see Imtiaz go downhill from being in control. Charges are filed against him and he is suspended.\n\nThe plot has a periodic rise and fall of characters, but that hardly moves the audience. The first half shows Rohith as the hero and in the second half, it is Sri Vishnu; but by the time the film ends, we couldn\u2019t care less. It is such a farce to show Imtiaz letting Raju go scotfree just because he gets to know the former had once saved his sister. The entry of Rajeev Kanakala doesn\u2019t impact the story. The story seldom deviates but what is conspicuous is the lack of strong casting. Sri Vishnu who has done noteworthy roles in his earlier films isn\u2019t effective here; he is passive throughout the film. The climax scene where he meets his daughter is a terrible let down.

For the remaining 1.56 lakh hectares, farmers depend on sources such as groundwater. For the irrigated extent, the government collects water tax from the farmers through the Revenue Department and disburses the same to the WUAs for maintenance of canals. In the existing system, the VRO issues demand notices to the farmers and collects cash from them. The notices are issued twice a year for kharif and rabi. As per statistics, the tax collection is a mere 37 per cent in the district. As against the total demand of Rs.31.41 crore (including Rs.16.21 crore arrears), only Rs.11.61 crore has been collected so far. Of it, hardly 50 per cent reaches the WUAs, forcing the latter to postpone the canal development works. The lacuna in the collection and disbursement is attributed to insufficient staff in the rural pockets and the workload on the existing employees. \u201cThe new system envisages timely generation of demand notices online by the Collectorate itself.

We\u2019ve had everything from Prince of Persia to Lara Croft, and more recently Warcraft .\n\nHowever, the one thing they all have in common is their inability to recreate the magic of their original game series. Perhaps this was due to polarised views of the game developers and the actual filmmakers. In a welcome move, video game publisher Ubisoft\u2019s film division, Ubisoft Motion Pictures, decided to enter the arena with the live-action feature Assassin\u2019s Creed . Based on the eponymous game, the film is the first time a publisher is involved in the making of a video game film. Naturally, expectations were high, especially when stars such as Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard were announced as leads.\n\nNot living up to legacy\n\nUnfortunately, the film has done little to take forward the game series\u2019 legacy. Instead of having the game\u2019s actual protagonist Desmond Miles in the film, Ubisoft sought to create an entirely new character named Callum Lynch (Fassbender) to tell the audience of the conflict between the Knights Templar and the Assassin\u2019s Creed. For centuries, a group of assassins has been protecting the Apple of Eden, which contains the DNA to free will. In present day, Lynch \u2014 a descendent of Aguilar de Nerha, a member of a secret order of assassins \u2014 is a death row convict. He escapes execution thanks to Abstergo Industries, the modern-day embodiment of the Templar Order. The company has developed a machine, the Animus, which uses Lynch to access Aguilar\u2019s memories to find the Apple of Eden. The machine transports Lynch into the body of Aguilar and his world.\n\nThe premise of the film is pretty much the same as the game. Its execution, however, lacks the finesse, intrigue and excitement the series is renowned for. Indeed, the plot is perhaps too complex to be reimagined within the span of a couple of hours. The characters arcs are too complicated, often left unexplained. For instance, Aguilar\u2019s lover and partner Maria (Ariane Labed) is barely introduced. She just pops up, and a kiss shared between the two is a moment of realisation for the audience.\n\nThen there\u2019s the recreation of the Assassin\u2019s Creed universe \u2014 which includes the world of the Spanish Inquisition \u2014 where director Justin Kurzel (famous for his previous collaboration with Cotillard and Fassbender in 2015\u2019s Macbeth ) makes a few amateur mistakes.\n\nFor one, his constant back and forth between present-day Lynch (in the Animus macine) and his embodiment of Aguilar is very jarring. We don\u2019t get to enjoy the old-world combat sequences that make the game thrilling. And when we return to Lynch strapped into the Animus, we\u2019re yearning to return to Aguilar\u2019s world.\n\nWith barely enough time to explain the plot, Kurzel in the end resorts to oversimplifying the principles that the game is much loved for . For instance, rather than explain what the game\u2019s famous Leap of Faith manoeuvre, the director has Abstergo Industries\u2019s head scientist Sophia Rikkin (an absolutely wasted Cotillard) merely mouth the words.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty wrong with Assassin\u2019s Creed and very little that\u2019s right. Fans of the game will perhaps be happy with the recreation of their favourite characters on the big screen. But that\u2019s about it. The uninitiated, though, will walk away confused. You\u2019ve been warned.\n\n- Deborah Cornelious\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed\n\nDirector: Justin Kurzel\n\nStarring: Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, Charlotte Rampling and Michael K.

The 100 odd employees of the Cement Corporation of India\u2019s Adilabad unit who have not quit, have been waiting for 18 long years for the factory to restart and for the over 3,500 workers and staff of the Sirpur Paper Mills at Kagaznagar town in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, the wait has entered third year.\n\n\u201cNo political party is serious in addressing our problem,\u201d observed a trade union leader from the CCI as he recalled the events of the last two decades. \u201cEveryone seems to be interested in selling away the unit instead of protecting the livelihoods of the poor workers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe leader, who did not want to be quoted, said the Adilabad Cooperative Spinning Mill which was closed in 1996 is an example of how governments deal with issues related to sick industrial units. Instead of reviving it to safeguard the interests of the nearly 800 staff and workers of the spinning mill in cooperative sector the then Telugu Desam Party government sold it to a private party in 2,000. In 1998 the CCI unit in Adilabad stopped production throwing the lives of its nearly 3,000 permanent, contract and outsourcing workers in disarray. Since then, all top political leaders including former Chief Minister of unified AP, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and present Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao have promised to do everything to reopen the factory.\n\n\u201cI will be retiring tomorrow (December 31, 2016) without seeing the factory produce cement once again,\u201d lamented the president of CCI Employees Union S. Vilas. \u201cIf the State government extends working capital besides waiving off Rs. 4 crore of our debts and relaxing Sales Tax collection for the next 5 years, the Centre has promised to revive the unit,\u201d he pointed out, underscoring the reticence of the State government.\n\n\u201cIn our case the government is interested in prolonging the issue until the next election,\u201d said Sirpur Paper Mill Parirakshana committee convenor Tumma Ramesh as he talked of the efforts made by the government to reopen the unit since the last two years. \u201cThere is a mismatch between what the government says it is doing to revive the mill and the given rules for doing so,\u201d he accused.\n\n\u201cThe property of SPM is not being evaluated as per norms,\u201d he explained of the discrepancy. \u201cAlso, the government is not stating that the present employees and workers will be allowed to work if the unit reopens,\u201d he added.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/article16967613.ece/BINARY/2729HI-W003.ART+GJO12H34O.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["S Harpal Singh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/Revival-of-sick-units-a-distant-dream/article16967614.ece", "title": "Revival of sick units a distant dream"}, {"text": "No different:The complete potential of the Mathadivagu dam in Adilabad district is yet to be realised.\u2014 Photo: S. Harpal SinghS. HARPAL SINGH;S. HARPAL SINGH - S_ HARPAL SINGH\n\nThe Telangana government\u2019s hurried approach in improving irrigation potential in the State has exposed some of the lesser known yet important aspects that go into planning of dams that weren\u2019t executed.\n\nOne such aspect is the calculation of the cost benefit ratio of projects, which looks more like an exercise in manipulation of statistics.\n\nThe Central Water Commission and foreign funding agencies like the Japanese International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank underscore the need for projects being economically justifiable, and hence insist on the calculation of cost benefit ratio at the planning stage itself.\n\nAs per their norms, the ratio should be at least 1:1.5 in terms of returns spread over a period of 10 years from the date of the facility going operational. \u201cDepending upon the contemplated capacity of the reservoir, the Agriculture Department gives us a plan for crop diversification in the project ayacut to enable farmers draw benefits from it to the maximum extent possible. The economics of agriculture in the given area before and after the advent of irrigation is taken into consideration to arrive at the ratio,\u201d a senior engineering official disclosed as being one of the aspects of planning dams and canals.\n\nSurprisingly, officials do not consult the targeted beneficiaries on their plan for the proposed crop diversification, many of whom continue cultivating traditional crops. This is one of the major reasons why the full potential of projects does not get realised even after spending hundreds of crores. For example, in the Satnala project in Jainad mandal, the irrigation potential remains at 12,000 acres \u2014 50 per cent of the contemplated ayacut of 24,000 acres.\n\nThough the Agriculture Department had given a plan for cultivation of paddy, jowar, and millets under the project, cotton has remained the chief crop as farmers remained uninformed about such cultivation and utilisation of water by going in for crop diversification.\n\n\u201cThe yield of cotton is between eight and 10 quintals per acre, but this is due to the cultivation of hybrids rather than availability of water,\u201d said Tudum Ramulu, a farmer of Mediguda village which falls under the project\u2019s ayacut. Satnala was actually designed to provide irrigation in kharif but delivers only during rabi just to prolong cotton crop.\n\nThe under-construction Chanaka-Korta barrage across Penganga river, which has merited special attention of the State government, is likely to end up like other projects. Farmers under its ayacut are uninformed about crop diversification envisaging reduction in cotton area from 4,543 hectare by about 500 hectare and increase of soyabean area and introducing cultivation of vegetables on 1,670 hectare.\n\nWhen told about the intricacies of planning irrigation projects, a farmer from Korta village in Jainad mandal expressed surprise. \u201cWhy are we being kept in the dark despite the promise to release water from the barrage in the coming kharif,\u201d he asked.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/article16967611.ece/BINARY/2729HI-W001.TH_+GJO12H32B.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["S Harpal Singh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/Aspects-that-never-go-in-the-planning-of-irrigation-projects/article16967612.ece", "title": "Aspects that never go in the planning of irrigation projects"}, {"text": "Mediation by judicial officers of Adilabad district court on Thursday resulted in uniting an estranged couple after 11 years of discord.

In fact, ever since the TRS came to power two-and-a-half years ago, it had been a down slide for the Congress party and also for the the Telugu Desam and YSRCP parties as far as the number of their elected representatives were concerned. In the last two years, 12 out of the 15 TDP legislators and 9 out of the 21 Congress MLAs crossed over to the ruling party, while the lone YSRCP MP and the party\u2019s three legislators joined the TRS. Following this, Speaker S Madhusudhana Chari, approved the merger of YSRCP Legislature Party with the TRS.\n\nThe depleted strength of the Opposition members is reflected even in the ongoing Assembly proceedings.

This has also increased the commuting time for people going towards Gachibowli as well as towards Masab Tank.\n\nEveryday, about 550 city buses of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) make more than 7,200 trips to disgorge about 3,60,000 commuters at the twin bus stops. Then there are dozens of buses from the districts of Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, as well as buses run by SETWIN corporation, from which passengers alight and clamber aboard. This takes the total number of commuters to over 4 lakh.\n\nAbout half the number of passengers, which comprise farmers from Chevalla and Parigi to students and senior citizens, have to cross the road walking on two zebra crossings. Add the quirky agile autorickshaws and it is a fine recipe for chaos on one of the busiest highways of the city.\n\n\u201cThe peak hours are between 4.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. when all the buses come packed and everyone is in a hurry to cross the road.

When she regained consciousness, she found herself locked in a room in Panipat. She was then sold off to Subhash, who took her to his village in Jind and married her the same day. Though she is Muslim, he renamed her Pooja and married her as per Hindu tradition. Finding no escape, she continued to live with him. One day, she managed to call up her parents and gave them the address.

It wasn\u2019t just because people were yet to shake off the previous night\u2019s excesses, the first day of 2016 was also the first day of the Delhi government\u2019s ambitious plan to curb the number of vehicles plying on the roads, in an attempt to reduce air pollution.\n\nThe maiden run of the odd-even vehicle-rationing scheme, from January 1 to January 15, was a reaction to the toxic levels of pollution in the preceding months, which had led the High Court to say that living in Delhi was like \u201cliving in a gas chamber\u201d in December 2015.\n\nWhen Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the odd-even scheme and other anti-pollution measures on December 4, 2015, environmentalists and Delhiites in general felt that something was finally being done to improve the city\u2019s air quality.\n\nLittle change\n\nAbout a year later, not much changed. November 2016 saw some of the worst smog the city had experienced in decades, with levels of highly toxic particulate matter (PM) rising to 14 to 17 times the safe level. In fact, the smog episode in the first week of November forced the government to take strict measures, some of them for the first time, including closing schools, stopping construction activity and shutting down the Badarpur power plant.\n\nBetween last winter and this winter, air quality parameters don\u2019t show an improvement. The Hindu analysed the Air Quality Index (AQI) data for Delhi from January 1 till December 29 and found that not even a single day could be classified as having \u201cgood\u201d air, as per the National Air Quality Index standards.\n\nAction or reaction?\n\nAt the same time, an analysis of the levels of PM2.5 \u2014 fine particles small enough to get embedded in the lungs \u2014 coupled with policy announcements and implementation of schemes by the government, shows that actions were taken when pollution was already high. For instance, the promise of vacuum cleaning of roads was made in December 2015, and again in November 2016 \u2014 both at times when the levels of pollution were high.\n\nAnumita Roychowdhury, an executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment and the head of its air pollution and clean transport programme, said that the focus on pollution in winter alone was preventing gains in air quality.\n\n\u201cWe have seen an interesting mix of actions that started last winter. But then, we could not sustain the momentum. The long-term action that was needed for sustained gains did not take place. As a result, we found ourselves in another emergency; we were not prepared for this winter,\u201d Ms. Roychowdhury said.\n\nThe actions being referred to all started due to the intervention of the judiciary.\n\nThe Supreme Court in October 2015 imposed an additional charge on commercial vehicles entering Delhi; and there was a freeze on registration of diesel vehicles.\n\nAfter years of environmentalists asking for it, a regional graded action plan was announced for the NCR, as per orders of the apex court. But, this is yet to be notified by the Centre, said Ms. Roychowdhury.\n\n\u2018Long-term action needed\u2019\n\nBut, apart from these emergency measures, long-term and systemic changes to various sources of pollution \u2014 transport, industry and waste burning \u2014 are yet to be announced.\n\n\u201cSome good steps were taken by the judiciary and the government, but there is a lack of comprehensiveness to the actions,\u201d said Sunil Dahiya,acampaigner with Greenpeace India.\n\nFor instance, when it comes to public transport, the Delhi government has just announced that fares of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses would be cut to encourage use from January 1, 2017. But on the other hand the ridership of DTC buses is on the decline, said Ms. Roychowdhury, adding: \u201cWe must not forget pollution when winter is gone\u201d.\n\nDespite steps being taken by the government and intervention of the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal, certain challenges remain.\n\nFor instance, the Delhi government attributed the unprecedented smog episode in November to the burning of crop residue in Punjab and Haryana.\n\n\u201cWhile the population in Delhi is concerned about pollution and long-term health effects, the same may not be true for the farmers burning crops in those States,\u201d said Shubho Roy, of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.\n\n\u2018Must become poll issue\u2019\n\nMr. Roy reckoned that the political parties in the respective\n\nStates gained nothing by forcing the farmers to change their existing method of uprooting stubble and adopt environmentally-friendly practices, which may be expensive.\n\n\u201cTill clean air becomes an electoral issue, serious long-term changes may be unlikely. Policy-makers and political parties will need to understand that this is an issue of fundamental rights. Right to life cannot go without right to clean air,\u201d Mr. Dahiya said.\n\nDelhi Environment and Forest Minister Imran Hussain was unavailable for comment.\n\n(With inputs from Samarth Bansal)\n\nIn November, Delhi saw some of the worst smog it\n\nhas experienced\n\nin decades", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/article16967143.ece/BINARY/2016---The-year+G0I12HC4L.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Damini Nath"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/A-slapdash-fight-against-rising-air-pollution/article16967147.ece", "title": "A slapdash fight against rising air pollution"}, {"text": "Over a month after the demonetisation was announced, daily wage labourers who gather at Hauz Qazi Chowk in Old Delhi are a distressed lot, thanks to the lack of work.\n\nThe Hindu\u2019s visit to the chowk on November 24, two weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement, found the daily wagers out of work, but positive that something good would come out of it.\n\nBut on Wednesday, some of the workers here couldn\u2019t contain their anger any more. \u201cPeople are talking about black money at a time when we are unable to have one meal a day,\u201d said Dhanveer, a construction worker from Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Badaun.\n\nHe added that the only jobs the workers found were those that didn\u2019t pay much.

Unfortunately, many people seeking changes in their Aadhaar cards had not brought necessary documents along.\n\nWhile the exhibition did not generate much curiosity, some staff members approached visitors to educate them about online payments. Rajdeep Tantia, a village level entrepreneur (VLE), was one such representative. \u201cMy aim is to educate as many people as I can about cashless transactions. So, I am on the lookout for anyone who may show even a little interest,\u201d said Mr. Tantia.\n\nOnline payment\n\nA similar approach to educate people was seen at a Mother Dairy counter.

However, he was arrested and imprisoned before he could meet her. No one has ever seen or heard from him since.\n\nDesperate to hear a word from their now 31-year-old son, his Mumbai-based parents Fauzia and Nehal Ansari protested at Jantar Mantar here on Thursday.\n\nAfter completing his studies, Hamid started looking for a job. After several failed attempts to find one in India, he found a job in Kabul. Despite his parents\u2019 reluctance, Hamid left for Kabul.

Hamid\u2019s parents learnt that he was arrested soon after he entered Pakistan, tried by a Pakistani military court and awarded three-year imprisonment.\n\nSavings exhausted\n\n\u201cSince he has been in jail since 2012, he has served his sentence already.

Coincidentally, Ms. Shehzadi, who was facing threats for helping us, has gone missing too,\u201d she said.\n\nHamid\u2019s parents made several attempts to contact the authorities, but in vain. Even as social boycott forced them to change their address, the couple exhausted all their savings searching for their son. Besides writing to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the parents have met Union External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj five times, so much so that \u201cshe recognises me even from a distance\u201d, said the mother.\n\nHamid was expected to be deported to India in November.

According to Opposition leader Vijender Gupta, Dr. Aggarwal is the son-in-law of Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s sister-in-law. In July this year, the BJP had attacked the AAP government over alleged nepotism in appointing Dr. Aggarwal.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Aggarwal, son-in-law of CM\u2019s sister-in-law, as Private Secretary to the Health Minister has been made in violation of all rules. Had there been an advertisement for the post, thousands of qualified candidates might have had an opportunity to apply for the same,\u201d Mr. Gupta alleged.\n\nA senior government official said it is the prerogative of the Minister to appoint his OSD and there was no irregularity involved in appointing Dr. Aggarwal to the post.\n\n\u201cDoctors working in Delhi government\u2019s hospitals are recruited as OSD to Minister and Dr. Aggarwal and two other doctors were on deputation. Since October, he has not been holding any official post in the Delhi government as Mr. Jain had discontinued Dr. Aggarwal\u2019s services. Dr. Aggarwal had been appointed on contractual basis.

No, that\u2019s not the start of a joke, but the premise of Aaron Blabey\u2019s The Bad Guys series published by Scholastic. The books are about a quartet who really really look like Bad Guys, in fact, everyone thinks they are terribly Bad Guys, scary and dangerous. But what they really really want is to be heroes, especially Mr. Wolf. Unfortunately, everyone keeps judging the Samaritans on how frightening they look, even the dapper suits don\u2019t seem to help their image.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make something that my overly-sophisticated eight and 10-year-olds would think was cool,\u201d said Blabey over email. \u201cIt was also a reaction to seeing a lot of deeply boring Early Reader books being brought home from school. Some books seem to have been designed to discourage children from ever wanting to read again. It was my hope to provide an antidote to that.\u201d\n\nWritten and illustrated by Blabey, the comic chapter books are fully fun. Each page elicits a few chuckles, and some are simply laugh out loud. No surprise then that The Bad Guys has been extremely successful in Australia and is now available in India as well. \u201cKids really seem to love it,\u201d said Blabey. \u201cAnd kids who don\u2019t like to read books are loving it too. THAT is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. I\u2019m immensely proud of that: kids who consider books to be Kryptonite are queuing up for the next instalment.\u201d\n\nBut they are more than just funny stories. In Episode 1, The Good Guys Club sets off to rescue 200 puppies locked up in a maximum security city dog pound (their hopes and dreams are trapped behind walls of stone and bars of steel) and in Episode 2 \u2013 Mission Unpluckable, their daring plan is to rescue 10,000 chickens from a high-security cage farm (never mind that one of their members is a notorious chicken swallower). These are narratives that will be loved by animal advocacy champions. \u201cIt\u2019s more about characters who\u2019ve simply been judged their whole lives because of the way they look,\u201d said the Australia-based Blabey. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re animals is inconsequential. One of them \u2014 Wolf \u2014 wants to transcend his situation. His counterpart \u2014 Snake \u2014 is resigned to it. Their polar approaches to handling this dilemma is the engine of the series.\u201d\n\nThe Bad Guys explores attitudes and discrimination at the same time, using humour deftly to present the issues. \u201cI find Wolf heart breaking,\u201d said the bestselling author. \u201cHe can\u2019t understand why no one can see how nice he is. The world\u2019s preconceived notions of what the boys are is a rich and satisfying seam of material to mine and for the record, I love making this series more than I can say.\u201d\n\nBlabey effortlessly switches between writing and illustrating comic chapter books and picture books, including the adorable Pig the Pug series and Piranhas Don\u2019t Eat Bananas. Blabey said that his approach to the books is completely different. \u201cI walk when I write picture books. The rhythm of walking helps me write in verse. I walk until I have a book,\u201d he said. \u201c The Bad Guys , on the other hand, is written like a screenplay, sitting at a desk, on a Mac. The process of switching between them is like crop rotation (Joni Mitchell famously referred to moving between song writing and painting in the same way. I\u2019ve stolen that from her.)\u201d\n\nAs he walks about the Blue Mountains thinking up his stories, Blabey pens them down on phones and other such entities. \u201cI like mediums of impermanence, like phones, white-boards and napkins, because they encourage naughtiness,\u201d he said. \u201cHandsome notebooks demand reverence. Every mark seems to diminish their beauty. My notes app, on the other hand, feels utterly transient, so I tend to be more relaxed and playful when I write on it. I love white-board too.

The Central government had discontinued the high-value currency notes on November 8.\n\nMangesh Bhalerao, general secretary, Allahabad Bank Employees Union, said, \u201cNo crowds were seen at banks because things have eased in cities like Mumbai, but the problem still persists in semi-urban and rural areas. This is because those who wanted to exchange or deposit old currency have already done so.\u201d\n\nAnil Prabhu, general secretary, Punjab National Bank Employees Union concurred with Mr. Bhalerao in that normalcy has been restored in Mumbai, adding, \u201cThe lull is because of what can be called as the internal rationing of funds by banks. Since cash inflow from RBI is so less, we call customers in rural areas in batches and ask them to take less cash to adjust with the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe salaried and working class customers tend to throng banks for withdrawals only after the first day of the month, when their salaries are credited. December 30 being the month-end, these customers are not left with much in their accounts to withdraw. Crowds will start coming in after January 1,\u201d N.

The \u2018jal-poojan\u2019 for a giant statue of the Maratha king Shivaji in the Arabian Sea and an hour-long event from the imposing dais at the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) marked the end of an eventful 2016 for the State; a year in which the social, political and economic landscape underwent discernible changes all at once.\n\nEven before Mr. Modi had ended his whirlwind tour, a young Devendra Fadnavis emerged as the State\u2019s most powerful leader. When he swiftly rose to galvanise a section of unruly BJP supporters that sultry afternoon, it was evident that Mr. Fadnavis had come out of the shadow of his cabinet colleagues.\n\nBy throwing open infrastructure projects worth Rs 1.06 lakh crore for Mumbai, he successfully presented himself as a larger-than-life visionary. A nationally televised \u2018jal-poojan\u2019 of the statue meant that the Marathas community,which has been organising a silent, was placated for now.\n\nBut cut to the start of 2016, and it was not all rosy.\n\nThe year had began on a sour note as the state battled drought and the consequent water scarcity, farmers\u2019 suicides,and a severe malnutrition epidemic. Daunting challenges for any state.\n\nTo its credit, the State government's implementation of the Jalyukta Shivar project to augment alternative sources of water in villages made a difference in improving the situation. When the monsoon arrived, the results were visible.\n\nHowever, the State\u2019s approach to malnutrition and farmer suicides remained shortsighted through the year. Much of the state\u2019s machinery and manpower was needlessly diverted to force change dietary habits of malnourished families in tribal areas while merely waiving off bank loans rather than bringing farmers completely out of a financial rut did not yield results. The suicides continued.\n\nNot surprisingly, the state government\u2019s score on social indicators left much to be desired in 2016.\n\nAt the start of the year, key administrative reforms were introduced to change the way Maharashtra conducts business. These included steps taken to decentralise bureaucracy, digitise governance, and lay the foundation for a cashless economy, much before Mr Modi\u2019s address on demonetisation on November 8.\n\nIn February, the mega Make In India event brought these slew of reforms to fruition with an assured investment of Rs 7.94 lakh crore. However, several MoUs took time to take off in the absence of land and better connectivity to backward regions. Clearly, the ease-of-doing-business parameters were yet not put in place, and both India and Maharashtra fell a point each on World Bank\u2019s Doing Business rankings by the middle of 2016.\n\nAs it turned out, major business MoUs did not materialise. But steps towards decentralisation and digitisation brought better bureaucratic efficiency. For better or for worse, faster clearances become the order of the day even as environmentalists cried foul over regulatory mechanisms being sidelined in the process. There was a sense of stability to the State, however fickle it may have appeared.\n\nThe stability soon gave way to turbulence mid-2016 when key State politicians faced charges of corruption including NCP\u2019s Chhagan Bhujbal, BJP\u2019s Eknath Khadse, Pankaja Munde, Girish Bapat, and Vishnu Savra; all of who faced serious charges of impropriety. It was alleged that Mr. Bhujbal had laundered money in order to avail of kickbacks from a contractor who constructed the swanky Maharashtra Bhavan in New Delhi.\n\nMr. Khadse was on the radar for illegal allotment of land to his relatives while he was still a minister. Both Mr. Khadse and Mr. Bhujbal could not weather the resulting political storm. The former was forced to resign, while the latter was sent to jail after a case was registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\n\nMeanwhile, the government\u2019s poor performance on social indicators meant class and communal tensions came to fore all at once. The quota fever visible across the country caught on to the state\u2019s backward communities with Marathas, Muslims, OBCs, and Dalits all demanding reservations. Some communities demanded the dilution of the Atrocities Act in the case of the Dalits. These sentiments were further fanned by the rape of a young girl at Kopardi (in Ahmednagar, around 300 km from Mumbai) and led to the historic mobilisation of the Maratha community. The last three months of the year saw hundreds of thousands of Marathas getting onto the streets, and attending protest marches at Aurangabad, Beed, Parbhani, Osmanabad Jalgaon and even Nagpur during the winter session of the State assembly.\n\nThe protest din was replaced by demands for the Chief Minister\u2019s ouster, and it appeared that the State\u2019s recovery from corruption scandals had hit a speed bump. But the government sailed through these turbulent times owing to happening of two events: demonetisation of currency on the night of November 8 and a subsequent verdict in BJP\u2019s favour in the municipal council polls.\n\nMr. Fadnavis personally walked away with the victory credit, having led the party in more than 30 rallies leading up to the elections. The impact of demonetisation on the farming sector had been drastic, but once again the negatives got overshadowed by the government\u2019s focus firmly shifted now to turning rural economy digital.\n\nThe State\u2019s telephone density has been on the rise, and stands at 93 per cent. By swiftly seeding crores of Aadhaar cards to Jan Dhan and Rupay cards during the year, the state government rode the digital wave post the demonetisation announcement to tide over a possible crisis.\n\nMaharashtra now stands on the cusp of change, and for better or worse, 2017 holds promise and hope of a better future, provided the government shows the same alacrity in implementing proposed projects and schemes as it has shown in getting clearances.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/article16967471.ece/BINARY/31bm_Sharad.ART+GVR12HF4C.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Sharad Vyas"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Hunger-deaths-cast-shadow-on-roller-coaster-year/article16967473.ece", "title": "Hunger deaths cast shadow on roller-coaster year"}, {"text": "A Mumbai-based organisation, Arpan, works towards creating environments free of child sexual abuse (CSA). It holds child safety education, both for children and the adults around them, including teachers and other staff, in schools, institutions or communities dealing with children. These free courses are conducted in three hour-long sessions over four to six days. The first is with teachers, then with parents (to take their consent and involve them), and finally with children.\n\nFor younger children, it starts with being taught to understand and appreciate their own bodies, which is important to build self-esteem, and then to properly identify private body parts, which helps them express their problems. Next, they are taught to understand the difference between safe and unsafe touch, to deal with unsafe situations and ways to escape them. Older children are also taught their legal rights; for instance, that abuse does not just mean inappropriate touch but also inappropriate speech, or being asked to look at videos or pictures. The sessions then guide the children about feelings of guilt if they are abused, and encouraging them to open up with trusted adults around them.\n\nAnnette Koshy, principal of MVM High School, Andheri (W) where these sessions were conducted, says: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that teachers be made aware of dealing with child sex abuse, since we are involved with so many children. The team was very dedicated and thorough professionals; they are very unassuming and do not hamper working of the school.\u201d\n\nPooja Taparia, Arpan\u2019s founder and chief executive, says, \u201cI feel very hopeful about the present and future where children will grow in an abuse-free environment.\u201d She says it is important that adults take on the responsibility of protection, helping children participate in their own safety and letting them know they can seek help in unsafe situations.\n\nArpan has also brought out personal safety education kits \u2014 for teachers, parents and community leaders, to enable them to educate, detect, handle and cope with CSA \u2014 in English, Hindi and Marathi.\n\nThe writer is a freelance journalist\n\nEducational institutions and parents can arrange for a free session by Arpan at their premises.

Despite the onset of Chillai Kalan, the harsh 40-day winter spell, there is a hubbub. Some are playing cricket, the rest looking on. Soldiers from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in mobile bunkers stand guard on the boundary wall; fingers locked on the trigger which, at the hint of any trouble, can spray pellets or tear gas. Three newly dug graves in the \u2018Martyrs Graveyard\u2019 bear testimony to the violent and troubled times of 2016.\n\nJust metres away from the graveyard, Nousheen Baba and her sister Iqra Baba recall how they could not hold themselves back from watching the funeral procession of 12-year-old Junaid Ahmad on October 9. Security forces allegedly emptied an entire pellet cartridge from close range at Ahmad and the Valley exploded in anger and sadness at the loss of a young life. \u201cDo you know how it feels to stay cooped up inside your room for five months with shattered window panes reminding you of the constant presence of violence,\u201d asks Nousheen, a second-year science student of Government College for Women, Nawakadal and aspiring chartered accountant. The windows of the Baba household bore the brunt of the clashes which erupted between security forces and protesters.\n\nBut Nousheen is eager to put the painful year behind her and even manages a shy smile. As a warren of houses in the highly congested Narwara locality in downtown Srinagar greets the eye, a tiny silhouette in a shiny grey cover makes its presence felt in the small courtyard of the Babas. Beneath the cover is the family\u2019s first motor-driven two-wheeler. Courtesy Iqra, a Bachelor of Commerce student at the same college her elder sister goes to, who was rewarded by the State government for securing 85 per cent marks in her Class XII exam. \u201cIt\u2019s our first scooter in the family. We are all learning to drive it,\u201d says Iqra\u2019s father Mushtaq Baba, a weaver. The Scooty is Nousheen\u2019s constant companion too ever since Iqra brought it home nearly two months ago. From college to market, to visiting her friends, it is her lifeline to a future she dreams about.\n\nDreams on wheels\n\nIn the first phase of the two-wheeler scheme, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti handed over the keys to 450 scooters to graduation-level students of Government College for Women, Nawakadal and Government Women\u2019s College, Baramulla on November 6. Only meritorious students whose family income is under Rs.4 lakh per annum are eligible for the scheme, which is being extended to all degree colleges of the State. In Jammu, 300 scooters were handed over to eligible students.\n\nMufti sees the Scooty as a game changer in improving the education of girl children who come from economically weaker sections. \u201cI have lived a common man\u2019s life and gone to college on a bus. I know the difficulties women face while using public transport. You feel it is safe sitting next to an old man, till he starts nudging you in the elbow; the unwelcome attention can be harrowing for any woman,\u201d says Mufti, explaining the rationale behind her scheme. She recalls a young woman she spotted riding a scooter in Srinagar earlier this year while on her way to the State Assembly. \u201cThis girl was short and slim but it was her confidence that was striking. The idea took shape right there. We took the decision to bear 50 per cent of the cost of the bike,\u201d she says.\n\nThe government has dovetailed many Central schemes meant for women empowerment to provide these scooters. \u201cI wish I had one and could ride it freely. A girl who owns a Scooty now will never have to request her brother or father to go places. The two-wheelers give women a sense of control of things,\u201d says the Chief Minister, adding, \u201cWomen are the first casualty of violence. Investments must be made to empower women.\u201d\n\nIqra, for one, feels empowered, never mind the taunts of the local boys as she drives past: \u201cThe two-wheeler has earned me azadi (freedom) enough to go to tuitions late in the evening.\u201d Five km away from the Baba household, Nargis Rasool, the eldest of four sisters and a brother, borrowed money to avail the Scooty scheme. \u201cMy father treats me like my brother\u2019s equal now since I started driving the Scooty. It is like taking part in a revolution. Though many elders did object to my driving saying \u2018how can a girl ride a Scooty on the street?\u2019, my parents supported me,\u201d says Nargis, a final-year Arts student of Government College for Women, Maulana Azad Road. Her 90-plus percentage in the Class XII exam helped this civil services aspirant to bring the first-ever vehicle to the Rasool household, a family of shawl weavers. Nargis has become an inspiration for the extended family, including six female cousins. \u201cTheir parents are now forcing them to study hard to secure a Scooty on merit,\u201d she says.\n\nReviving an old craft\n\nNamda, a carpet made through the process of felting by hand, needs both muscle and money. For Arifa Jan, 31, who completed in 2010 her Craft Management Entrepreneurs\u2019 Leadership Programme from the Craft Development Institute, Srinagar, the challenge was to turn around the fortune of this dying craft at a time when exports of the once-world-famous Kashmiri carpet had plummeted. According to a government survey, the total production of handicrafts rose to Rs.1,614.59 crore by 2008 against Rs.200 crore in 1990-91 but Namda exports had gone down 97 per cent and amounted to less than Rs.40 lakh annually.\n\n\u201cThe use of cancer-causing dyes and poor cotton mix pushed Namda to the verge of extinction,\u201d says Arifa. She infused science and healthy processes back into the craft to make it market-friendly. In 2010, she had to brave prolonged curfew spells to reach her unit to weave the first-ever assignment of 300 Namdas, meant for an exhibition in New Delhi by Dastkar, an NGO working with craftspeople across India.\n\n\u201cEight-five per cent of my Namdas were sold. I still remember the taunts of a German buyer who kept saying we were producing fake Namdas,\u201d says Arifa, who credits an unknown buyer from Delhi for her first brush with success. The buyer later turned out to be Gulshan Nanda of the Crafts Council of India. Nanda reposed faith in Arifa and the money flowed. \u201cMs. Nanda would come to me and ask serious questions about the craft,\u201d says Arifa.\n\nIn 2013, the Crafts Council of India selected Arifa for a trip to Kyrgyzstan to study their processes of carpet-making. Back home, she scouted for an Australian merino sheep hybrid that was introduced in the Valley in the 1960s. \u201cIts wool is what goes into exquisite Namdas,\u201d she says.\n\nFor the first time, Arifa introduced pre-processes to weed out hazardous particulates from the wool and ensured no cancer-causing dyes make their way into it. \u201cEven artisans who\u2019d make chain stitches on the carpet used to complain of chest pain earlier due to the use of synthetic ingredients,\u201d she says.\n\nThe daughter of a retired State Road Transport Corporation employee, Arifa is now eyeing business opportunities in the U.S. even as her stable has expanded to 27 artisans, 17 of them women. \u201cI am rooted in Kashmiri art and culture. I want wages and artworks of women to shift to a competitive level. Artisans have suffered a lot in Kashmir \u2014 we have to bring them on a par with sellers,\u201d she says.\n\nWeaving a new formula\n\nIt\u2019s 4.30 p.m. The rolling wooden bobbins with multi-coloured fine threads and the neatly thrown over-and-under shuttles meant for woofs and warps are showing no signs of the day\u2019s tiredness. Bollywood music from the 1980s breaks the monotony of the shuttles at work. It\u2019s the first loom in Kashmir where a woman is at the helm, and an attempt is underway to replicate the famous floating garden on Dal lake, Char Chinari, as a design relief from traditional motifs in Kani shawls, a fine handwoven mix of pashmina and shahtoosh wools. \u201cWe have developed a new formula for shawls. No one can steal it. It\u2019s original and a major departure from the past. My work drives my clients to my loom \u2014 I have requests pending from many exporters,\u201d says Shaheena Akhtar, 31. Like Arifa, Shaheena, a resident of Srinagar\u2019s Nowshera area, too comes from a humble weavers\u2019 family, but in just five years, she is being credited with giving a new identity to the Kani shawl, picking up the State\u2019s Best Entrepreneur award along the way three years ago.\n\nShaheena\u2019s journey to finding acceptability in markets in Italy, Germany and Dubai has been anything but easy. \u201cNot everyone treats you as a daughter or a sister when you start something like a shawl business. My character was questioned because I used to meet officials. I struggled to have bank guarantors because my father was just a small-time weaver. It was not easy to raise money,\u201d she recalls.\n\nFollowing a training stint at the Entrepreneurship Development Institute, Pampore, in 2011, Shaheena was able to start with an initial investment of Rs.8 lakh. In a year she counted her first one lakh rupees in earnings. \u201cMy father had never counted Rs.1 lakh at a time. I am good at counting money. But that Rs.1 lakh was something I could not count for a while. A girl from Kashmir, counting money, and all the men around looking in awe. A strange feeling seeped in,\u201d she recalls. As business grew, she enlisted her brothers\u2019 help. \u201cOf the 18 workers at the loom, 12 are relatives. I am proud that in such a short span I have a turnover of Rs.1 crore,\u201d she says.\n\nRoh-i-Kashmir (Soul of Kashmir), Shaheena\u2019s company, has tie-ups with six major exporters for the 60-70 shawls her loom produces annually. \u201cMy thrust is quality. My shawl sells for Rs.4.5 lakh in the international market for its intricate and exquisite work. It takes more than nine months and two labourers to finish one intricately woven Kani shawl,\u201d Shaheena adds.\n\nAn English tea room in Srinagar\n\nHistorically, Kashmir has drawn its taste buds from Central Asia, including the famous kahwah (a traditional green tea preparation) and multi-cuisine wazwan . Roohi Nazki, a former employee with Tata Interactive Systems, is trying to get Kashmiris hooked on something very different: the tea room. It\u2019s been worth the effort, if increasing footfalls at her small joint, Chai Jai \u2014 modelled after tea rooms in England \u2014 are anything to go by.\n\nIt was a solo holiday trip to England in 2013 that changed Roohi\u2019s life and introduced her to the niceties of tea rooms. In the Cotswolds villages of south-central England she saw mirror images of the Kashmir Valley. Moving back to the Valley after living in Mumbai for 22 years, Roohi\u2019s parents initially persuaded her to stay on in a corporate job, but she just knew what she wanted to do next.\n\nAs one walks down the British-era manicured embankment of the Jhelum river in Srinagar\u2019s Polo View area, Roohi\u2019s \u2018little England\u2019, complete with castle-room interiors and cobblestone floors, is hard to miss in the age-old Mahatta Building.\n\nLaunched in July this year, Roohi is reviving teas from bygone times like Daam Tyooth (a herbal tea), Bunafshan tea (flower tea), Qadri tea (a herbal tea with sugar mix), Nettle tea and Gulkand kahwah (mix of saffron and sun-dried rose petals). \u201cI have 28 varieties as of now and I am working on a collection of 200 varieties,\u201d she says.\n\nSmall steps to giant strides\n\nWhile it is too early to see these women as enduring successes, having a woman Chief Minister at the helm seems to have given a fresh impetus to a more inclusive society in a State which has primarily been in the news this year for its mind-numbing violence. A slew of measures initiated by Chief Minister Mufti \u2014 including reservation of 10 per cent land in industrial estates for women entrepreneurs, the Ladli Beti scheme aimed at the economically poor, an all-woman entrepreneurs\u2019 market, all-woman buses and all-woman police stations \u2014 are aimed at women.\n\nThe opposition National Conference spokesperson Sarah Hayat Shah acknowledges that every step towards empowerment of women is always appreciable, but simultaneously points out the troubled ground reality in Kashmir where even young girls have been killed or blinded in the wave of protests since July. \u201cI am afraid the scooters may not be able to heal the wounds,\u201d she says.\n\nUltimately, beyond the overhang of violence, a lot of the contestations with patriarchy are essentially atomic. \u201cEvery time I watch a fisherwoman of Srinagar, I can see her making her own rules as she negotiates her space and life,\u201d says Roohi, now in her 40s.\n\nJust like she fights her own little everyday battles, such as taking trolls \u2014 who were \u2018outraged\u2019 at her bringing a feel of Christmas to Chai Jai with cakes and candies from Mumbai \u2014 off her Twitter feed, one resolute click at a time.\n\nI am rooted in Kashmiri art and culture. I want wages\n\nand artworks of women to shift to a competitive level.\n\nArifa Jan, 31\n\nOwner, carpet manufacturing unit\n\npHoto: V. V.

It has spent much of the year lodged in a widely broadcast battle with the Union government over judicial appointments. Led by Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, who retires on January 3, 2017, the court has fought this contest presumably to assert its independence from executive and legislative control. But, somewhat counter-intuitively, the wrangle has had a deleterious impact on the court\u2019s moral authority. The court has not only been intransigent in allowing the executive no say in matters of appointments, despite the Constitution\u2019s clearly contrary mandate, but it has also failed to make the existing system \u2014 selections through a \u201ccollegium\u201d of senior judges \u2014 more transparent and democratically justifiable. What\u2019s worse, while constantly stressing on its apparent autonomy, the court has often appeared to cave in to the very majoritarian impulses that it is tasked with refuting.\n\nWhile it is no doubt difficult to make grand assertions about the Supreme Court given that it doesn\u2019t sit en banc , as one, and given that it comprises judges who can be disparate in their outlook and attitudes towards what constitutes a proper judicial role, collectively the court\u2019s choices in 2016 have shown us that any independence it enjoys hasn\u2019t guided it towards concerted courage in decision-making. On the contrary, particularly in enforcing fundamental rights \u2014 which it ought to see as its most important function \u2014 the court has, barring a few notable exceptions, scarcely served as the keeper of the country\u2019s conscience.\n\nTussle between judiciary and executive\n\nThe present battle lines between the judiciary and the executive were drawn in October 2015 when the court delivered its verdict in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of India . Here, the court struck down the 99th Constitutional Amendment and consequently the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), which had been created to replace the collegium. Four of the five judges who heard the case (Justice J. Chelameswar dissented) found that the primacy the collegium enjoyed in choosing the country\u2019s judges was a part of the Constitution\u2019s basic structure. According to the majority, the NJAC \u2014 a body that was to comprise the law minister, two eminent laypersons, and the three senior-most judges, including the CJI \u2014 in removing the primacy that the judiciary enjoyed in selecting its own members infracted the basic structure, and, therefore, had to be quashed.\n\nAlthough this is a decidedly bizarre conclusion when you consider that the collegium finds no mention in the bare text of the Constitution, many political observers believed that it was a verdict that was necessary to ensure the independent functioning of the judiciary. But not even the most ardent supporters of the judgment backed the existing status quo. The collegium system indisputably required reform. To this end, in December 2015, the Supreme Court, after receiving a slew of suggestions on how to improve the collegium\u2019s functioning, directed the executive, whose sovereign power to make appointments it had divested in its verdict, to prepare a draft memorandum that would lay down the procedure for the collegium\u2019s functioning.\n\nSince then, there has been a constant back and forth between the two wings, with no end apparently in sight. But if the court were so loath to giving any leeway to the executive in the process, it makes one wonder why the task of preparing the draft memorandum was assigned to the government in the first place. Making things worse, one of the collegium\u2019s members declined to participate in a meeting of the group in September this year, on grounds purportedly of a lack of transparency in its working. Whatever one might think of Justice Chelameswar\u2019s methods in expressing his demur, his objections only made it clearer that there was something broken at the core of the system: the collegium, in his assertion, was simply functioning in a manner beyond the remit prescribed for it by the court\u2019s own judgments.\n\nTwo flawed decisions\n\nWhile enshrouding the process of appointing judges from any reasonable standard of candour and accountability, the court has simultaneously made choices that only show that the present system doesn\u2019t necessarily produce the kind of counter-majoritarian judiciary that a democracy requires. Two decisions from the past year exemplify the court\u2019s remarkably unflattering outlook on fundamental rights. The first, rendered in May \u2014 Subramanian Swamy v. Union of India \u2014 rebuffed a challenge to the colonial-era criminal defamation law and upheld Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nJudges, under any sensible interpretation of their role, are required to apply rules derived from precedent, statutes, and the Constitution, in checking legislative or executive excesses. But the court in Subramanian Swamy did none of this. It brushed aside legitimate concerns about the chilling effect that the criminal defamation law has had on speech with a frightening disdain for tradition and precedent. Justice Dipak Misra, who wrote the judgment, in holding that the law constituted a reasonable restriction on the right to freedom of expression, made no effort whatsoever in relying on any of the constitutionally sanctioned limitations to free speech. Instead, he appealed to his own distinct sense of what ought to constitute the law, by carving out of the ever-malleable Article 21, which guarantees a right to life and personal liberty, a \u201cright to reputation.\u201d Worse still, he conceived a concept of \u201cconstitutional fraternity,\u201d hitherto unknown to Indian law, which, he ruled, demanded an \u201cassurance of mutual respect and concern for each other\u2019s dignity.\u201d This reasoning is flawed on many counts. But chief among them is the fact that neither of the precepts relied upon by Justice Misra finds mention in Article 19(2), which contains the legal basis for restricting speech. The consequence of the judgment is vastly damaging: it has the effect of placing values that rest on individual predilections above the right to freedom of speech, which, by any equitable interpretation of the Constitution, ought to stand on firmer footing.\n\nThe second decision, delivered on November 30, extraordinarily takes rights even less seriously. In an interim order on a public interest litigation filed by a supposed social activist from Bhopal, the court directed that all cinema halls in India play the national anthem before the screening of any film, and that persons present in the hall compulsorily stand up to show their respect for the anthem. Quite apart from indulging in rule-making that ought to be the prerogative of Parliament, the order sidesteps its complete disregard for basic liberties by offering no reasons whatsoever. In doing so, the court simply assumed the role of a super legislature, having tasked itself with the power to impose its own brand of distorted nationalism.\n\nThere have been other instances in 2016 of the Supreme Court using what it perceives to be a power to do complete justice to achieve precisely the converse \u2014 among other impacts, these verdicts set a poor example for high courts which are concomitantly tempted to extend the use of their writ to perform what are principally legislative functions. But what\u2019s been even more damaging to the Supreme Court\u2019s legitimacy has been its dithering under pressure. Despite issuing interim orders as early as in 2013 making the securing of the Aadhaar card optional, the court has failed to adequately enforce its directions \u2014 seemingly every day the government and its various agencies appear to extend the use of the unique ID linking it with the provision of a number of essential services. The court can be excused for failing to haul up the government for contempt of its orders were it to expedite its hearing of the basic challenge to the UID scheme. But the Constitution Bench established to determine whether India\u2019s citizens have a fundamental right to privacy, which the Aadhaar policy quite clearly appears to contravene, is yet to hear concrete arguments on the issue.\n\nChallenging demonetisation\n\nIn similar vein is the challenge to the policy of demonetisation. A number of petitioners have not only questioned the procedural validity of the government\u2019s and the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s various notifications, but have also contended that the policy infracts significant fundamental rights. Early this month, in \u201cContours of a challenge\u201d ( The Hindu , Dec.2), I had said that the manner of the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of these petitions \u201cwill tell us a great deal about the checks and balances that our democracy purports to provide.\u201d We now have a very quick answer, and it\u2019s not a good one.\n\nAfter many false beginnings, on December 16, the court directed the establishment of a five-judge bench to rule on the constitutional validity of the demonetisation notifications and on the legality of the policy\u2019s implementation. If we were to go by the example of the Aadhaar case, it is entirely likely that this policy too would be rendered fait accompli by the time the court gets around to hearing the challenge. In many ways, these acts of wavering in the face of public pressure showcase a Supreme Court lacking in moral courage. The harm in consigning to the academic challenges to laws that have an immediate bearing on our lives, which invade into our cherished liberties and into our ability to function as equal beings, is enormous. An independent judiciary, properly understood, far from being one that appoints its own members, is one that possesses the will and the conviction to resolve swiftly hard cases, uninfluenced by societal perception, in a manner that enriches the finest values of our constitutional tradition.\n\nSuhrith Parthasarthy is an advocate practising at the Madras High Court\n\nThere have been instances of the court using what it perceives to be a power to do complete justice to achieve precisely\n\nthe converse", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article16966856.ece/BINARY/31th_suhrith.TH+GAB12GLAH.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Suhrith Parthasarthy"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/2016-The-Supreme-Court%E2%80%99s-report-card/article16966858.ece", "title": "2016: The Supreme Court\u2019s report card"}, {"text": "The ceasefire reached between Syria\u2019s government and Opposition, with the mediation of Turkey, Russia and Iran, could be a turning point in the country\u2019s civil war. Unlike the two previous failed ceasefires this year \u2014 which were negotiated between Russia and the U.S. \u2014 the latest one is sponsored by countries directly involved in the conflict. The positive reaction from both the Syrian regime and rebel commanders to the announcement of the ceasefire by Russian President Vladimir Putin also suggests that the warring parties are willing to give diplomacy a chance. For the Syrian government, this is an opportunity to announce it is ready for a peaceful settlement. Though President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly claimed that he would retake the entire territory from the rebels, a military solution appears to be illusory. A prolonged conflict will exhaust the regime forces further and multiply the humanitarian costs. On the other side, after the victory in Aleppo, the regime could now negotiate with the rebels from a position of strength. For the rebels, the momentum is gone. Their support is limited to certain parts such as Idlib, Daraa and the outskirts of Damascus. The question they face is whether they should continue fighting a never-ending war of attrition or seek to gain leverage from whatever military influence they are left with.\n\nThere is a convergence of interests for Turkey and Russia in finding a peaceful solution. Having seen the U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia doesn\u2019t want to get stuck in Syria. By promoting a negotiated deal, it could retain its core interests in Syria while at the same time projecting itself as a power broker in West Asia. Turkey wants to limit the spillover effects of the war on its soil and stop Kurdish rebels from capitalising on the chaos in Syria. This explains why Turkey and Russia have come together now despite their bitter relations last year. But these objective conditions alone may not produce sustainable peace. It is still not clear which rebel groups have agreed to the ceasefire. Turkey supports only some of the rebel groups, while several other groups get support from Gulf monarchies. There are jihadist elements as well in the Opposition, such as Fateh al-Sham, that could play the spoiler by carrying out attacks on government positions. Besides, the Kurdish question remains unaddressed. If Kurds are invited for talks, Turkey might withdraw its support for the peace process. For now, however, if the ceasefire holds at least till next month\u2019s Astana summit of the related parties, it could be a new beginning for Syria.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-new-dawn-for-Syria/article16966854.ece", "title": "A new dawn for Syria?"}, {"text": "The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s biannual Financial Stability Report has once again flagged the fact that risks to the banking sector remain worryingly \u201chigh\u201d. That the risks have stayed \u201celevated due to continuous deterioration in asset quality, low profitability and liquidity,\u201d in the central bank\u2019s assessment, is cause for concern. Given the central role commercial lenders have in the financial system \u2014 serving to harness public savings and direct the flow of crucial credit to the most productive industrial and infrastructure sectors \u2014 any systemic risk to the banking industry has the potential to ripple across the entire economy. There has been no perceptible improvement in the health of domestic banks, even six months after the RBI\u2019s previous report had highlighted the sector\u2019s high vulnerability on account of the increase in capital requirement and worsening asset quality, spotlighting the need for urgent policy interventions. Some measures have been initiated and others are in the pipeline, including a draft Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill to address bankruptcy situations in banks and other financial entities. Still, there is every reason to prioritise the restoration of the sector\u2019s health as some of the risks inherent in banks may already be getting transferred to other segments of the financial markets, according to the RBI\u2019s report. A survey, of experts and market participants, conducted by the RBI in October-November reveals that among institutional risks, credit growth and cyber risk were seen as two key \u201chigh risk factors\u201d.\n\nThe appointment of Viral Acharya as Deputy Governor overseeing monetary policy at the RBI, therefore, comes at a crucial juncture. A former member of the Advisory Committee of Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission, he brings substantial expertise in both identifying and dealing with systemic risks in the banking sector. Having authored a number of papers on the risks lenders could pose to the wider financial system and even the sovereign\u2019s credit standing, he will have his task cut out. A proponent of sequestering and separately dealing with the stressed assets and bad loans on a lender\u2019s books, Mr. Acharya had in an interview suggested that the \u201cunhealthy parts of the troubled banks\u201d could be separated from the healthier assets and put into a \u2018bad bank\u2019 to prevent systemic contagion. With the RBI pointing out that banks saddled with bad loans were likely to remain \u201crisk-averse\u201d and find themselves lacking the capital needed to lend more to meet credit demand in the economy, the regulator and the government will need to work in close concert to expeditiously resolve this vital legacy issue.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Managing-risk-in-banks/article16966853.ece", "title": "Managing risk in banks"}, {"text": "New face of the AIADMK\n\nV.K.

While some have managed to happily get hundreds or thousands of Rs.2,000 notes, others have struggled to get one or two Rs.2,000 notes even after standing for hours in serpentine queues outside banks and ATMs.\n\nWithout assistance from bankers, it is impossible for corrupt people to acquire such large amounts of money in new notes. This in itself is sufficient to show that corruption still thrives despite the Prime Minister\u2019s promise to eradicate it.\n\nAnd what right does the government have to impose curbs on the quantum of money to be withdrawn from our own accounts? It looks like it will take at least another three months to restore normalcy.\n\nThe government has constantly changed its tune \u2014 from eradicating black money to counterfeit notes to transforming the economy into a cashless one. I hope the Prime Minister doesn\u2019t aspire for a second term.\n\nV.V.N.

I pity those politicians who oppose Mr. Modi just for the sake of opposing him.\n\nR. Ganesan,\n\nChennai\n\nDemonetisation has drawn resentment from all quarters. People feel the government did not do its homework before making the announcement. It is now a sit-and-watch game.

From the day the former Chief Minister was hospitalised until the day she died, a cloud of secrecy shrouded her health, leading to wild speculations and rumours among the people. Now a vacation Bench of the Madras High Court has also voiced its concern over the failure of the Tamil Nadu government to dispel all the doubts surrounding her death.

Post-2019, the entire capital gains becomes exclusive to India,\u201d the minister said.\n\nA significant apprehension about these pacts was the complete exemption of taxes on capital gains that investors could utilise in the name of double tax avoidance as these three countries had no capital gains taxes. \u201cSo the beneficiary would not pay any capital gains tax in India on the ground that the Singapore taxation rules would be applicable to them and there was no capital gains in those jurisdictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would set to rest the anxiety of the investors investing into India from Singapore,\u201d said Girish Vanvari, national head of tax for KPMG in India. \u201cEffective April 1, 2017, capital gains arising from investments made after April 1, 2017 will be taxed in India at half the domestic rate as in case of the amended Mauritius treaty and be fully taxable after April 1, 2019.\u201d", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/article16966841.ece/BINARY/tax-treaty-jait+GPO12H7L9.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Special Correspondent"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/Singapore-investors%E2%80%99-capital-gains-to-attract-tax-in-India/article16966842.ece", "title": "Singapore investors\u2019 capital gains to attract tax in India"}, {"text": "DOWN SHIFT:The cash crunch that followed the withdrawal of high value banknotes has resulted in a sharp slowdown in demand, according to economists.\u2014 FILE PHOTO\n\nThe Centre\u2019s decision to withdraw high value banknotes couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time for the recovering Indian economy as the cash crunch that resulted from the sudden demonetisation crimped all-round demand and tripped up the economic momentum that had steadily gathered through 2016, according to economists.\n\nStarting 2016 on a relatively weak base \u2014 with gross value added (GVA) growth at 6.9 per cent and gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.2 per cent in December 2015 \u2014 economic momentum recovered towards the middle of the year. GDP growth in March accelerated to 7.9 per cent and GVA growth rose to 7.4 per cent.\n\nAlthough the upsurge hit a hurdle in June, with GDP growth for the second quarter of FY17 falling to its slowest rate in six quarters at 7.1 per cent, a good monsoon and an imminent pick-up in demand seemed to have placed the economy in a sweet spot for higher growth, investments and, possibly, job creation.\n\n\u2018On the verge\u2019\n\n\u201cWe were on the verge of seeing a revival in consumer spending, which was already witnessed in September and October in particular, where the festival season demand had picked up,\u201d Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Care Ratings said. \u201cOverall, the Indian economy was poised to move towards the eight per cent growth rate mark.\u201d\n\nThe Centre's move to withdraw high value currency notes in November altered that script, though the government is confident that deferred consumption will still spur growth once the initial shock of the move is absorbed.\n\nMr. Sabnavis said that the policy environment had been positive leading up to the demonetisation announcement with the Centre sticking to its infrastructure spending target and the Reserve Bank of India expected to reduce interest rates due to the expectation of easing inflation. However, since demonetisation, consumption demand has slumped, which has halted the expected recovery in private investment.\n\n\u201cPost demonetisation, there have been distortions that have been be caused,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though the effect will be temporary, it will still be a dampening effect on the economy over the rest of the year. Even though we have low interest rates, that basic pick-up in demand for investment, which had been expected, has been deferred by another two quarters. Therefore, there will be a slowdown in the economy in Q3 and Q4.\u201d\n\nOn the infrastructure side, the main sticking point \u2014 non-performing assets \u2014 remains a problem independent of the effect of demonetisation, with banks not willing to lend for such projects.\n\n\u201cSo, that probably wouldn\u2019t have taken off, but definitely investment from the manufacturing side should have taken off,\u201d Mr. Sabnavis said.\n\nIIP index\n\nThe index of industrial production on average contracted by 0.1 per cent over the January-to-October period, with private investment faring very poorly and any growth in the index being mostly driven by consumption. The index reached its lowest level in the year in July, when it contracted 2.55 per cent. The best performance was in the preceding month, when the index grew 2.18 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe IIP will likely contract in the first quarter of calendar year 2017,\u201d said D.K. Srivastava, Chief Policy Adviser, EY India.\n\n\u201cSuch a contraction has been happening in investment demand, and now post demonetisation, it is visible in consumption demand as well. This would require a major fiscal stimulus on the part of the central government early next year, as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nInflation slows\n\nRetail inflation slowed significantly over the year, while the contraction in wholesale prices reversed. This meant that the growth rates of the Consumer Price Index and the Wholesale Price Index converged \u2014 coming the closest to each other in November, when the CPI grew at 3.6 per cent and the WPI at 3.15 per cent.\n\n\u201cInflation will be trending downwards in 2017, especially since the demonetisation effect will hit consumption demand, and hence prices,\u201d Mr. Srivastava said. \u201cThe effect will be seen in sectors as far and wide as food articles and real estate. This will give the RBI room to reduce its policy rates, and will also give banks room to pass these rate cuts on to the customers.\u201d\n\nGVA growth\n\nGrowth in gross value added has been slowing since the fourth quarter of the previous financial year (quarter ended March 2016), when it was 7.4 per cent.\n\nGVA growth for the second quarter of this financial year was 7.1 per cent, which is the lowest it has been since the quarter ended December 2015. That was before the demonetisation announcement, which economists said would dampen growth in the last two quarters of the fiscal.\n\n\u201cThe gross value added in the next year will come in even lower, as it will be hit by the demonetisation process,\u201d said EY India\u2019s Mr. Srivastava. \u201cGVA growth, since it is the output side, will respond with a little lag. It would probably for the year as a whole be limited to about 7 per cent, but demand as a whole will fall so GDP will be lower than GVA and will be about 6.8 per cent or so.\u201d\n\nCurrent Account Deficit\n\nThe current account deficit has contracted sharply over the last two years, with the amount touching $3.4 billion in September 2016, down from $10.9 billion in September 2014.\n\nThe CAD touched a more than two-year low in the quarters ended March and June, coming in at just $300 million.\n\n\u201cThe current account deficit will be very comfortable. Although exports have started recovering, the growth is near zero, and imports have fallen quite sharply and therefore there will be balance or near-balance in the current account deficit,\u201d Mr. Srivastava said.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/article16966845.ece/BINARY/30thNDSharad01_+GK512GV3Q.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/Note-ban-trips-economic-momentum/article16966847.ece", "title": "Note ban trips economic momentum"}, {"text": "A surge in non-cash transactions through digital options such as mobile wallets and debit cards is a clear sign that India is embracing the cashless economy, but it remains to be seen if this will continue when new currency notes come into circulation, the Centre and company officials said.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley assured people on Thursday that a large part of the currency that was in circulation on November 8, when the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were rendered illegal tender, had been replaced and more Rs. 500 notes were being injected into the system.

This is a serious violation of the norms of good governance by IOA which is the mother sports body and corrective action needs to be taken immediately.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Government is committed to protecting the autonomy of sports, it cannot remain a mute spectator to blatant violation of principles of ethics and good governance\u2026 till necessary corrective measure is taken by IOA,\u201d Goel added.\n\nFormer IOA secretary-general Randhir Singh called it the beginning of the end for the body.\n\n\u201cIOA heading for oblivion...

Sindhu and Sakshi Malik at the Rio Olympic Games headlined the wonderful performances of Indians across many a sport in the year gone by.\u2014 FILE PHOTO\n\nThe 2016 Rio Olympics was supposed to be India\u2019s coming-out party. The nation was expected to shed her sleeping giant tag with a rich haul of medals at the mega-event.\n\nIt was not to be. The blushes were spared by P.V. Sindhu, Sakshi Malik and the Paralympians, while the rest of the contingent returned empty-handed.\n\nThere were, however, plenty of other bright spots. Golfer Aditi Ashok and football club Bengaluru FC (BFC) broke new ground, while the junior hockey team scaled the highest peak.\n\nHighlights:\n\nSakshi Malik: When star wrestler Geeta Phogat was forced to miss the Rio bus after the Wrestling Federation of India suspended her for \u201cindiscipline\u201d, the onus fell on Sakshi Malik to fill the void. The 23-year-old from Rohtak, who competes in the same weight category as her illustrious peer, took the ball and ran with it.\n\nAfter losing to Russia\u2019s Valeria Koblova in the quarterfinal, Sakshi needed two victories in the repechage round to claim a bronze medal. In her second bout, the medal play-off match, she scripted a dramatic comeback \u2014 from a 0-5 deficit \u2014 to get past Asian champion Aisuluu Tynybekova. The nation rejoiced, and an agonising 11-day wait for a medal came to an end.\n\nP.V. Sindhu: Much like Sakshi, P.V. Sindhu did not enter the Games as the leading prospect. That honour went to 2012 London Olympics bronze medallist Saina Nehwal. Injury concerns to Saina, however, saw the ace shuttler make her exit in the group stages. A young, fit Sindhu, on the other hand, took on all comers.\n\nThe World No. 10 went on a giant-killing spree in the knockout rounds, defeating higher-ranked opponents like Tai Tzu-ying (World no. 8), Wang Yihan (World no. 2) and Nozomi Okuhara (World no.6) on her way to the final. Sindhu took on world champion Carolina Marin in the summit clash, but fell just short of claiming the ultimate prize.\n\nParalympians: Mariyappan Thangavelu (gold, men\u2019s high jump), Devendra Jhajhariya (gold, men\u2019s javelin), Varun Singh Bhati (bronze, men\u2019s high jump) and Deepa Malik (silver, women\u2019s shot put) helped India register a best-ever show at the Paralympics.\n\nThangavelu grabbed gold at his first appearance at the mega-event, while Jhajhariya finished on top with a world-record throw of 63.97m. Bhati and Deepa notched up personal bests, and the Indian contingent \u2014 para and otherwise \u2014 left Rio on a high.\n\nBengaluru FC (BFC): This club, all of three seasons old, captured the imagination of Indian football fans by reaching the 2016 AFC Cup final. The route taken was not easy, as the Bengaluru unit went up against defending champion, Johor Darul Ta'zim, in the semifinal.\n\nBFC, under newly-appointed coach Albert Roca, upset JDT 4-2 on aggregate, to become the first Indian club to reach the final of the prestigious tournament. A fairytale ending was denied, when Air Force Club (Iraq) prevailed 1-0 in a tense affair at Doha.\n\nEarlier in the year, BFC was crowned champion for the second time in three years, when it won the I-League title with a match to spare.\n\nJunior hockey team: Coach Harendra Singh and his wards became the toast of the nation when they were crowned as World champion, for the first time in 15 years. When India last won this title, in 2001, the squad consisted of a few players \u2014 like Deepak Thakur, Jugraj Singh, Viren Rasquinha and Prabhjot Singh \u2014 who would go on to become senior international stars.\n\nWill the likes of Harjeet Singh, Harmanpreet Singh, Dipsan Tirkey and Mandeep Singh, from this current junior team, follow in their footsteps?\n\nAditi Ashok: Right from her days as a young amateur competing on the professional circuit, Aditi Ashok was touted as a star in the making.\n\nThis Bengaluru golfer scored big in November, when she won the Hero Indian Open in Gurgaon.\n\nShe became the first Indian to win a title on the tough Ladies European Tour (LET), and just a couple of weeks later, doubled her tally when she finished on top of the leaderboard at the Qatar Open. These successes saw her named as the 2016 LET Rookie of the year.\n\nThe 18-year-old will compete in a few events on the elite LPGA Tour next year, where she will be expected to create more milestone moments.\n\nDipa Karmakar: Much like Milkha Singh\u2019s exploits at the 1960 Rome Olympics, gymnast Dipa Karmakar\u2019s fourth-place finish at Rio proved that you do not need to stand on the podium to stir up emotions.\n\nDespite losing out on a medal, she was welcomed home as a hero. Dipa, the first Indian female gymnast to compete in the Olympics, has lifted the profile of her sport in the country.\n\nHer efforts are sure to inspire plenty of young imitators \u2014 a blessing for gymnastics in these parts.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/article16967034.ece/BINARY/TH31-GEN-YEAREN+GUN12FVSV.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Ashwin Achal"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/article16967036.ece", "title": "Stars who gave fans a lot to cheer about"}, {"text": "reason to smile:The Kerala men and Railways women\u2019s teams which took the titles at the senior National volleyball championships on Friday.\u2014 Photos: V.

Railways's attempt at a three-peat thus stood foiled.\n\nRailways women won their ninth consecutive title with a 25-21, 21-25, 25-15, 25-21 win over Kerala.\n\nKerala had a superior blocking game, and Railways, especially at times when it was ahead with Kerala close on its heels, relied heavy on forceful play than fanciful.\n\nAt 22-20 in the second set, Manu Joseph's swat of a spike proved too good to dig out for U. Abdul Raheem who went down in a flash for it.\n\nManu, again for the next point, banged it across at open space, the ball too quick for anyone to even try to dig it out.\n\nThe third set resembled a never-ending tug-of-war with both teams pulling at each other, all determined and miser-tight. It was 6-6 at one point, 13-13 at another, and 24-24 before Kerala clinched it 26-24.\n\nThe fourth set was intense, too, as Railways pulled off from 25-all to win it 27-25.\n\nPlayers on either side slid, stretched and fell in the long rally when Kerala was up 25-24, which C. Ajithlal ended in Kerala's favour with a spike.\n\nThe women's match was also close-fought as the margins of win in three of the four sets \u2014 rather than the overall score \u2014 will indicate.\n\nThe Kerala women did ply the standard tricks to try and push their odds at a title win.\n\nThere was the feign-a-bash for a gentle push, as E.P. Sanisha did for Kerala to go 4-3 up in the first set \u2014 the ball dropped, close to the net, as the opponents, who had expected a full-blown spike were caught unawares.\n\nAnd, the feint-a-move for target space. For instance, P.P. Reshma rushed straight at the ball, also moving her arm as if to spike straight yet placing it cross-court. It didn't help that Railways saw through all of it for the most part of play.\n\nRailways got anxious and committed mistakes at crucial moments. It was a negligible glitch in its play though. Like, Minimol Abraham hit the ball off-court when it was looking to claim the first set at 24-19.\n\nThe results (finals):\n\nMen: Kerala bt Railways 25-17, 20-25, 26-24, 25-27, 15-9.\n\nThird place: Tamil Nadu bt Punjab 20-25, 25-20, 34-32, 25-21.\n\nWomen: Railways bt Kerala 25-21, 21-25, 25-15, 25-21.\n\nThird place: Maharashtra bt Andhra Pradesh 25-15, 25-17, 25-9.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/article16966951.ece/BINARY/th31-volley-ker+GVR12HG0B.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["S Prasanna Venkatesan"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/Kerala-men-emerge-champions/article16966953.ece", "title": "Kerala men emerge champions"}, {"text": "It was a year that opened up new horizons in Indian cricket as Virat Kohli led the Test team to great heights.\n\nThere is no prescience in cricket, but Anil Kumble\u2019s squad has set off in the direction that was visualised by some of the most astute cricket brains in the country.\n\nIt was a study commissioned by a pro-active set of administrators in the Board and it turned out to be a session that led to self-appraisal of a realistic nature.\n\nWinning at home ought not to be devalued because losing at home can also have severe repercussions.\n\nPioneering conclave\n\nKumble had taken over the reins of the team and a new set of work ethics was designed. To ensure that the treasure of talent was not under-utilised, a pre-season conclave was organised and attended by the who\u2019s who of Indian cricket.\n\nKumble, Kohli, M.S. Dhoni, junior coach Rahul Dravid, National senior and junior selection chairmen Sandeep Patil and Venkatesh Prasad gathered in Bengaluru to draw up a blueprint to take Indian cricket forward.\n\nThe experts analysed the strengths and weaknesses and it was concluded that the roadmap had to include playing conditions as the most critical ingredient of the programme.\n\n\u2018No doctored pitches\u2019 was the clear mantra as Kumble and Kohli insisted on consistency and proficiency on all kinds of pitches to be the deciding factor.\n\nTwelve Tests, including four in the West Indies, was the challenge. That nine of them were won, two in the Caribbean, gave an indication of the emerging stature of the team. Emphasis was obviously on consistency and there were many gains for Kohli\u2019s team.\n\nThe management took pride in the striking power of the bowlers. To get 20 wickets in a match on a consistent basis had been one of the targets and it was achieved with flair.\n\nBarring the Tests at Kingston and Rajkot (against England), the Indian bowlers, an enviable combination of pace and spin, skilfully achieved the task of creating victories. Bowling out the opposition was what the Bengaluru conclave had envisaged. It was achieved in style.\n\nThat the batting strength grew manifold was again a key factor in the team excelling in all formats of the game.\n\nThe top-order stabilised despite some injuries and lack of form for some. The welcome thrust has come from the lower-order where India can now count on more than handsome contributions. Never had the Test lower-order been so strong in contributing runs.\n\nGood bench-strength\n\nWhat pleased the team management most was the bench-strength coming good when it mattered. Young men were ready to take over, essentially because they had been prepared under the sound guidance of Dravid. There are three contenders for every slot now.\n\nTechnical adaptation to the situation, not technique per se , has stood out in the cases of Karun Nair and Jayant Yadav, two players who were backed vehemently by Dravid.\n\nThere are many more waiting in the wings and the obvious result-oriented communication between Dravid, Kumble, Kohli, Dhoni and the selectors augurs well.\n\nThe success that R. Ashwin achieved in tandem with Ravindra Jadeja was a huge factor in India registering such overwhelming results against the West Indies, New Zealand and England. Ashwin\u2019s true test lies ahead when the team plays more Tests outside India.\n\nGrey areas like injury management, fitness for some and poor catching in the slips also need to be addressed.\n\nThe best team in the world? The all-time best Indian Test team?\n\nThe debate that occupies the minds of fans and administrators is the least priority of the players. The team management is not influenced by such market-driven comparisons.\n\nPresently, the regime of Kumble, Kohli and Dhoni is working on the golden rule of short-term targets where consistency is all that counts. Kohli\u2019s team has the potential to emerge the best-ever Indian Test combination. It has set benchmarks to better the Sourav Ganguly era.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/article16966920.ece/BINARY/TH31-CRIC-YEARE+GJ212H57A.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Vijay Lokapally"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/A-well-defined-work-ethic-has-done-wonders/article16966921.ece", "title": "A well-defined work ethic has done wonders"}, {"text": "STEPPING IT UP:Saketh Myneni feels that playing doubles has had a positive impact on his singles game, sharpening his returns and net-play.\u2014 Photo: S.R. Raghunathan\n\nUntil he qualified for the US Open in late August, Saketh Myneni held a rather interesting record. Ranked 143, he was the highest-ranked player on Tour then never to have appeared in the main draw of an ATP Tour-level event.\n\nThat he broke the jinx at the Flushing Meadows and reached a career-high ranking of 137 was a joyous occasion for him. He had played college tennis in the United States and he proudly called it a \u201chome away from home.\u201d\n\nAs the 2017 tennis season dawns, he will now have a chance to finally make his ATP main draw debut at his real home \u2014 the Aircel Chennai Open, which begins here on Monday. At 192, he is the highest-ranked Indian singles player and hence was awarded a wild card entry.\n\n\u201cI had a great year,\u201d Myneni said, reflecting on the season gone by. \u201cI had a great hard court season. I played all the four Slams [three qualifying and one main draw appearance]. I am pretty happy with what I have been doing in the past eight to 12 months. I was unfortunate to lose in five sets to Jiri Vesely [US Open first round]. But I am not sad about it.\u201d\n\nA win over Vesely would have handed Myneni a dream match against World No. 1 Novak Djokovic. But that did not seem to bother him much as he felt he had a lot of things to be proud of.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look at it that way. You have to be happy with whatever progress you have made. I was enjoying it. Even when I was struggling with cramps, I was playing smarter tennis. To go as an underdog and still compete like any other was great. In the end, I walked on my own feet back into the locker room,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI also played my first live Davis Cup rubber. The pressure, the scenarios all are different in five-set matches. There have been lots of positives.\u201d\n\nHis first brush with five-set matches has also made him realise the need to work on his fitness with greater rigour. Both against Korea in the Davis Cup and at the US Open against Vesely, he cramped.\n\n\u201cI am trying to keep up my intensity for two to three hours continuously. I am working on my nutrition too. These are the things which can give me a little edge. My tennis has always been explosive. It\u2019s first-strike tennis. I need to get used to playing longer matches and for that I have to train harder,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI also try serve-and-volley a bit more. Generally I play aggressively from the baseline. But [coming to the net] gives you an additional dimension.\u201d\n\nIn that, Myneni said, doubles had played an important role.\n\n\u201cPlaying doubles is one of big reasons for my improvement in singles. For example, it helps target your returns better. In singles you get a full court but in doubles there is limited space. You also do a lot of serve-and-volley and attacking. It\u2019s a style you would want to replicate in singles,\u201d he said.\n\nIf all goes well, 2017 could well be the year in which all the incremental gains made in the past year or two leads to greater glory.\n\n\u201cI need to make sure that I last the whole season. It hasn\u2019t happened in the last four or five years that I have been on Tour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress.

However, thanks to withdrawals, he has managed to get into the main draw at both tournaments.\n\n\u201cLast in in Chennai, last in in Australia...

Bedene had played three dead rubbers for Slovenia.\n\nHe has since moved the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Even as he feels that it has affected him, he says it has been worth it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I made a mistake. You know, I still have my chances. But yeah, they did affect me. I was 45 in 2015 and was then actually expecting positive news. That didn\u2019t happen, and I would have to say that affected me, especially after Miami.

How important is it to take the I-League to new places?\n\nThree-and-a-half years back we had a strategic meeting with FIFA about football in general in India. And one of the [facts that] came out was that there were not enough centres (the I-League) was touching. Four years back, we had 14 teams and six venues.\n\nThe main aim was to spread the game. That was then we decided to introduce corporate bidding. And Bengaluru FC was the first to get it. Now we\u2019ve got 10 teams and 10 different venues.\n\nWas it difficult to convince new teams to join this year?\n\nThe good thing about this year was that we got a record five teams to bid. I think the quality of the I-League has been great for the last two years; second to none. [Like] what BFC has done in India. It has proved that you don\u2019t need to be a 100-year-old club to be good.\n\nWill coverage and promotion be any different this year?\n\nLast year, 45 matches were shown live. This year it\u2019ll be 75 matches.\n\nThe remaining 15 matches will be streamed live. There is a huge market outside [India] also. We have had hits from USA and the Middle East.\n\nYou talk about a merger on one hand and spreading the I-League on the other.\n\nEveryone wants one league. The two leagues at the moment becomes a problem as it puts pressure on the players.\n\nIdeally, we need to have a league in the calendar that goes on for nine months. [It should be] the top league with the best teams. It is a work in progress.\n\nWe wanted to have this merger done by the time the under-17 World Cup starts. It\u2019s easier said than done as there are complications.\n\nWhat about the Youth\n\nI-League?\n\nOur focus has been on the youth league \u2014 the u-18 and u-15, and next year, we will be launching an u-13 league too. We might soon have a licensing criteria wherein a team will have to have u-18, u-15 and u-13 teams.

Sekkizhar describes how the child saint Gnanasambandar is a direct recipient of the highest jnana from Siva and Parvati. That is why his hymns focus on the path by which one can eradicate further births, pointed out Sri Mu Sivachandran in a discourse.\n\nIt is believed that the epithet Gnanasambandar, conferred by Siva Himself, is indicative of the jnana which this saint embodies. The Lord\u2019s solicitude towards him is manifest when He arranges to gift him a palanquin, an umbrella and trumpets. It is a relationship based on jnana and bhakti. He always addresses Siva as \u2018appa\u2019 and regards Siva and Parvati, for all their Paratva, as his divine parents, even as he reveres and loves his human parents.\n\nBeing compassionate by nature, he prays to Siva for His grace to alleviate the sufferings of the people. Once, he is placed in a tight situation by his father Sivapadahridayar who asks him to provide money for the conduct of a yagna. Gnanasambandar is upset because he is unable to disregard his father\u2019s request and also finds it difficult to ask God for money. He is not used to asking God for material gains. His mind, noted for its clarity and purity, is sullied momentarily at this point. He who has no other refuge than the Lord addresses Him in the following manner: \u2018Is it right on your part to make me ask for money? Is this the love you show me?\u2019\n\nSuch a demanding tone when making a request is more becoming of a Sundaramurthy whose possessiveness over Siva, whom he holds as his dear companion, is well known. But the saint\u2019s inherent viveka takes over the spirit of this \u2018pathigam\u2019 which inspires bhakti, loyalty and faith.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/Son-of-God/article16967026.ece", "title": "Son of God"}, {"text": "Kyle Abbott struck twice in the first seven overs to set up a 206-run win for South Africa on the fifth day of the first Test against Sri Lanka at St. George\u2019s Park here on Friday.\n\nIt took South Africa just 70 minutes and 13.3 overs to claim the remaining five Sri Lankan wickets and take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

They feel the relevance of the senior Nationals might be lost due to this.\n\nSpeaking to The Hindu , IWF vice-president Sahdev Yadav said: \u201cTwo officials from NADA collecting samples of only eight players where there are approximately 300 participating defies logic.\n\n\u201cThe top three from each category needs to be tested along with random tests of others. Till last year more than 60 samples had been tested in each of the National championship.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, Indian team coach Vijay Sharma added: \u201cThe rules in the National camp at Patiala are going to be very tough. IWF should make sure that each and every player is tested there ahead of the Commonwealth Games qualifying event.\n\n\u201cWADA may also conduct random tests. Players will have to be very careful with what they eat and drink.

Having sung in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi and Hindi, in his latest song \u201cDhaakad\u201d for Dangal , he captures the conviction of the sisters, while narrating their journey from their stint as amateur wrestlers to their entry into the Olympics. Through his throaty rough voice as he sings in Haryanvi, manifesting the rugged landscape of the arenas, with clouds of dust surrounding the sisters as they stride forward, Raftaar\u2019s proclivity to use the medium of music to tell stories is restated.\n\nHowever, Raftaar is switching space! He has collaborated with Mortem Tyldum for the upcoming sci-fi movie Passengers, which features Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in a space journey. His song \u201cAadat\u201d, recorded in the same studio as the movie. After composing a song titled \u201cMother Nature\u201d for the UN Climate Change Summit in 2014, this is his second big overseas project.\n\nCalling himself a \u2018storyteller\u2019 and \u2018poet\u2019 instead of a rapper, the autodidact in him comes alive as he talks about his humble beginnings and flair for rhyming he realised early in childhood. With a singsong yet stentorian voice, the weight in his voice justifies compositions like \u201cDhaakad\u201d and \u201cStand Up\u201d.\n\nRaftaar talks about his first Hollywood project, his beginnings as a singer and the changing trends in the music industry.\n\nHow was the experience of working with the Passengers team? What led to the composition?\n\nThe entire process went in raftaar! It happened quite fast. I was in Goa and had to come to Mumbai the next day. The same night I got a call from the Passengers team asking me to compose a song for them. They said they wanted my signature elements in it. I couldn't believe it. I thought maybe it\u2019s a Hindi version of Passengers or some other project in the same name. But, when I was told it\u2019s the same movieI got super excited.\n\nNo matter how successful you get, you should always crave for more. Next day, I was on a flight to the US and wrote the song. We reached the studio where the movie was shot and recorded in the same studio. Within 24 hours, everything was done and the video was edited as well.\n\nThe movie is about space and connection. How does your composition fit in?\n\nIt is about space, but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s about two people living in a secluded place. And Chris makes a beautiful statement in the film. He says that even if they were surrounded by people in a heavenly setting, he would have still chosen Jennifer. This is hard hitting and I have conveyed the emotions through my song.\n\nThe best part is that this it is my first love song. All my songs in the past have either been inspirational or party numbers. This is the first time I have sung something romantic.\n\nHow was this experience different from composing a song in India?\n\nFor me, it was definitely not different. I did the same things I do for a Bollywood movie or a composition back home. But, for them, having a Hindi song in a Hollywood movie is different.\n\nWhat's your signature style? What\u2019s the thread that connects all your songs?\n\nI am a storyteller. If you listen to my songs, I always try to convey a story, send messages across. Even \u201cAadat\u201d follows the same pattern. I am telling the story of Pratt and Lawrence in the movie. If you pay attention to the lyrics, you\u2019ll easily get the storyline of the movie.\n\nWhat are the current trends and patterns you see in the music industry?\n\nSee, there is nothing permanent in the industry. Romantic songs come and fade away and some other genre takes over, and then there are times when people like listening to Sufi music. It\u2019s really tough to make anything survive for long in this atmosphere characterised by transience. This generation is so fast and people want to listen to new stuff constantly.\n\nWhat makes a rapper different from any other singer?\n\nThe element of storytelling for sure. A singer would normally use a piece of lyrics, combine it with chorus and indulge in a lot of repetition. However, rappers have the power to utter 16-32 bars of poetry straight away. It's straight storytelling. It's straight delivery of everything you want to say. We\u2019re poets, bro! I call myself a poet with a bit of swagger, I never call myself a rapper.\n\nYou sing in multiple languages. Which is the language you connect to the most and like to sing in?\n\nI have sung \u201cDhaakad\u201d in Tamil and Telugu as well. I am a Keralite (his real name is Dilin Nair) and my first language is Malayalam. I have studied in a boarding school in Haryana and also know Punjabi. So, if you see, no language in specific is my favourite. But, Hindi comes naturally to me and is my comfort zone. I feel quite comfortable with Haryanvi and Punjabi as well. And, even if someone asks me to sing in Bengali and is ready to help me with it, I'll go ahead and do it.\n\nWhat's your biggest inspiration?\n\nWell, it\u2019s my own struggle. I encountered rap when I listened to Eminem and Linkin Park for the first time in 9th standard. And, in childhood I was really good at rhyming. From realising that I am good at it in the 2nd standard to realising that it\u2019s much more than that; it's about being skilled, having word-play, and telling stories. I used to check out videos online and watch English music channels on TV regularly. I come from a very humble background. Both my parents were working. I had to come out of that social bracket and achieve something better. That pushed me to do it.\n\nWho\u2019s your favourite singer or rapper?\n\nMy favourite rapper is Jayceon Terrell Taylor, who goes by the stage name The Game. I also have his name tattooed on my hand.\n\nYou've sung different kinds of songs ranging from inspirational to party. What's your most preferred type?\n\nI love doing songs like \u201cDhaakad\u201d and \u201cToh Dishoom\u201d. Both of them are filled with messages. Talking about the income group I come from, it\u2019s very difficult to balance a glamourous lifestyle with my roots. But, honestly if given a choice, I would always want to do songs with messages.\n\nWhat are the associations and plans you have for 2017?\n\nMy song with A.R. Rahman is coming out soon. I have also done a dance song for Jolly LLB-2 , which is also their title track. There is also a song with Sunny Deol that I am doing. The first song I ever sang and danced on as a kid was from Narsimha , a Sunny Deol movie. Now, it feels great to be standing with him in a song and singing for him.\n\nWhat advice would you have for budding artists?\n\nI always say the same thing. Be a wannabe. That's because if now you\u2019re a wannabe, one day you\u2019ll be somebody. Just the will to be somebody is very important. So, be a wannabe.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967663.ece/BINARY/31ndmpraftaar.A+GTI12CUAG.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Sidharth Yadav"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Meet-the-%E2%80%98Dhaakad%E2%80%99-singer/article16967664.ece", "title": "Meet the \u2018Dhaakad\u2019 singer"}, {"text": "Divya Sathyaraj believes playing a sport can be a fun alternative to spending boring hours at the gym. \u201cMost of my patients believe dieting and exercising are mutually exclusive\u2026 that you needn\u2019t diet if you exercise and vice versa,\u201d says the nutritionist and daughter of actor Sathyaraj, \u201cBut the truth is you need to balance both to be fit.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019ll explain that in detail in a documentary film titled A Bit to Be Fit.

This New Year Eve, Nikhil, who juggles avatars from DJ, VJ and MC to music promoter and festival director will be at VR Bengaluru\u2019s Sky Deck.\n\n\u201cI always love playing in Bangalore,\u201d Nikhil says over the phone. \u201cIt is my home town. Even though I\u2019ve been living in Mumbai all these years, I still call myself a Bangalorean. You like having your friends around you on New Year\u2019s Eve and in Bangalore, I always feel like I\u2019m surrounded by friends. There\u2019s absolutely no place like home.\u201d\n\nAt the party, Nikhil says: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot of fun \u2013 that goes without saying. I\u2019m playing some of the biggest hits of 2016 and earlier and some unreleased new music as well.\u201d\n\nThough he has not played at the Sky Deck before, Nikhil says he\u2019s heard that it is a beautiful location. \u201cHowever, it may become chilly later in the night. Bring some warm clothes and if you don\u2019t have woollies, bring a close friend to keep you warm,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI want people going away with a big smile on their faces and feeling like they\u2019ve got their money\u2019s worth. You\u2019re sure to have an amazing time welcoming 2017.\u201d\n\nTalking about the year gone by, Nikhil says, \u201cThis year, has been a good one for me personally. I\u2019ve launched a range of new projects, including two festivals in Goa and a clothing line last week called Sheltr.\n\nFor the planet, it has being a lousy year. We lost many talented musicians. It has been a weird time with people being rewarded for being vicious, hateful, racist and abusive to women.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not just in America; it\u2019s in India and everywhere else. We are legitimising a culture of putting other people down and being abusive. I really feel for where we are as humanity right now. We need to do something as a culture to fix that going forward into 2017.\u201d\n\nNikhil will be kicking off the year with the VH1 Supersonic Festival in Pune. \u201cWe\u2019ve booked an incredibly talented DJ who everyone thought was impossible to book for India called Eric Prydz. The Swedish DJ is mortally afraid of flying. I\u2019ve managed to convince Eric to come to India for the first time. And I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll ever do it again. It is going to be a huge treat for everyone in India.\u201d\n\nNikhil will also be fine-tuning his brand of clothing in the New Year. So has he got his hands full? He replies with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who believes 24 hours is a very long time. So I\u2019m always up for doing more. I\u2019m also looking forward to playing in Bangalore again. I\u2019m not saying this just for the interview. There really is no crowd like the one in Bangalore.\u201d\n\nNikhil says there is a lot of diversity coming up in 2017. \u201cThanks to the Internet, we have people embracing forms of music that were unheard of earlier.\n\nIn the electronic space itself, we have Down Tempo, Deep House and Techno coming to the fore. Drum and Bass are making their presence heard as well. We\u2019re also seeing tremendous talent emerging in India. And generally, if you\u2019re a fan of music, you\u2019re going to be exposed to a whole lot of it in 2017. There will be more acceptance and growth to all forms of music because access to them has become better.\u201d\n\nAnd to those who hope to take the leap of faith into the music space, Nikhil affirms there is no substitute for hard work. \u201cAnd although a clich\u00e9, there\u2019s no substitute to being unique either. Nobody needs another David Guetta or Coldplay. You\u2019ve got to be the very best you. That is what upcoming musicians need to aspire to be. Put in the hard work and always be your own worst critic. That will take you all the way.\u201d\n\nWelcome the New Year with the headliner at VR Bengaluru Black Box\u2019s rooftop venue, Sky Deck, on Whitefield Road, with supporting acts by DJ Rohit and Sonic-X on December 31 from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967015.ece/BINARY/31bgamrNikhilCh+G8N12EOVI.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Allan Moses Rodricks"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/%E2%80%98I-love-playing-in-Bangalore%E2%80%99/article16967668.ece", "title": "\u2018I love playing in Bangalore\u2019"}, {"text": "If you haven\u2019t hopped on to the velvet train yet, tonight\u2019s your chance. Those flirty ruffles in shirts and balloon sleeves aren\u2019t the only outcome of the global Victorian fashion obsession we\u2019ve been experiencing all season. Fashion critics say the luxe fabric will star at all New Year\u2019s Eve parties that matter, on both men and women. \u201cThis time of the year, expect OTT. Look for voluminous sleeves, \u201880s details and a lot of bling. Fortunately, the makeup is toned down, with just a strong mouth or brow. And the hair stays natural with a messy pulled-back look,\u201d begins Krishna Mukhi, stylist and former Fashion Features Director atHarper\u2019s Bazaar India.\n\nHere\u2019s breaking down the dress code for the night ahead:\n\nVelvet reloaded: Metal and velvet \u2014 you could do either one or both. High-octane glamour from Balmain, Gucci and Givenchy make the cut this season, but if you are partial to Indian designers, Huemn, the inventive Rajesh Pratap Singh and Atsu are the labels to hunt down. \u201cHuemn did \u201880s nostalgia very well at fashion weeks this year, with distinctive fur accents,\u201d continues Krishna. At the online fashion address, Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop, the label\u2019s black-and-gold cutdana embroidered gown, at Rs. 65,500, is a keeper. Meanwhile, the store\u2019s founder, Pernia Qureshi, also votes for Atsu\u2019s panelled, lace-up and one-shoulder wrap dresses in black. \u201cAtsu\u2019s clothes are feminine and chic and they fit like a glove. Both he and Shivan & Narresh did their best collection at Lakme this year,\u201d she insists. Her website has had many takers for Shivan & Narresh\u2019s palazzos with gold skein work.\n\nBerry fantastic: Blackest blackcurrant it is. Deep, dark and dramatic hues were undeniably the biggest trend for lips this season, and Krishna references the berry-like mouths on show at Rodarte, Marni and Erdem. \u201cMany of our Indian designers did it too, but the most striking of all were the lacquered black-cherry pouts at Louis Vuitton and Dior, the latter created with Dior\u2019s Rouge Dior in Poison coated with Dior Addict Ultra Gloss for a mirror finish. My personal favourite, though, is MAC\u2019s Cyber,\u201d she adds.\n\nFor the eyes, glitter and metallic updates are inevitable in the corner of the eye or near the cheekbones, but we\u2019re betting on the berry eye (wine shades) seen on Emanuel Ungaro\u2019s models at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year.\n\nBoots on board: You can\u2019t take thigh-high boots and slits out of the party circuit, but chunky platforms and strappy feminine sandals are definitely in. \u201cIf you plan to go partying in flats, they must have an element of glamour, with jewelled or faux leather detail. There is baroque too, toned down,\u201d says Krishna, pulling out images of velvet loafers from Miu Miu.\n\nInstant shine : For pocket-friendly last-minute purchases, like Bansri\u2019s body harness or Outhouse\u2019s chokers, try Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop and multi-designer stores like Amethyst and Evoluzione.\n\nMen\u2019s style\n\nJacket check : \u201cCarry the right attitude. This is the best accessory any man can ever possess!\u201d is sartorial savant Rohit Bal\u2019s blunt advice to our party-ready man. Some cajoling later, \u201cIt depends on what kind of party it is. I would suggested fitted and flared anarkali shapes under a sherwani or a long jacket for an occasion. A well-fitted leather jacket made to your size is a must-have. You can carry it off in a number of ways.\u201d Another winner, Huemn\u2019s bomber jackets from Amazon India Fashion Week in October.\n\nThe custom suit : Borrow a few pointers on dressing sharp from Mumbai\u2019s suit expert, Troy Costa \u2013 everyone from actor Aamir Khan to Randeep Hooda is a fan. Someone else who swears by the \u201cbest to be overdressed rather than underdressed\u201d rule is Abhishek Paatni, the only new-age designer invited to showcase at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights this month. \u201cA custom peak lapel velvet blazer with a cotton shirt and pants would be my party look. To accessorise, throw in a lapel pin and a square. A nice pair of Oxford shoes in patent leather will complete your look,\u201d he promises.\n\nMale metallic: While tweed, wool, leather, suede and scuba will continue to rock the dance floor, Rajesh Pratap Singh\u2019s metal jacket is the most defining look of 2016. Check out artist Subodh Gupta in the \u2018steel\u2019 suit if you need convincing.\n\nMind the extras: Shantanu & Nikhil revived brooches for men, but in an edgier avatar, at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights. The magazine\u2019s editor, Che Kurrien, says Tom Ford\u2019s reinvention of a classic fragrance, the Tobacco Vanille, wins hands down this season. And for some quirk, he suggests you take the Adidas Originals Tubular X sneakers for a spin tonight. Top photographer and Kingfisher Calendar man, Atul Kasbekar, insists on self-tied bow ties, if you are going formal. \u201cTom Ford has a brilliant pre-tied bow that looks like you\u2019ve knotted it. And because it\u2019s so cool, it costs 175 pounds at Selfridges!\u201d he concludes.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967682.ece/BINARY/Text-28-12-2016+G2G125IC4.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Rosella Stephen"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Through-the-cocktail-hour/article16967690.ece", "title": "Through the cocktail hour"}, {"text": "Hello fellow-earthlings, we did it! We went around the sun one more time. What I don\u2019t understand is, why are we celebrating it as if it is some sort of an achievement by us humans. Clearly, we didn\u2019t have a choice no? Gravity held us here and so we stayed. Otherwise, Chennai folks would have drifted off to another planet and put their kids into a \u2018strict\u2019 engineering college in Jupiter or some such. That would\u2019ve been a real achievement.\n\nBut I digress. I wanted to talk about celebrating New Year\u2019s. Or more specifically, about New Year\u2019s Eve parties. Now, if you were raised in Chennai, there is only one way of celebrating New Year\u2019s. You don\u2019t. Boss, who in their right mind spends money to usher in the New Year yaar! I understand that we have all been told people are supposed to do \u2018cool\u2019 things. Like sliding chest-down along a table like Kamal Haasan, screaming \u2018Hi everybodyyy\u2019 in S.P. Balasubrahmanyam\u2019s voice, but you only ended up crashing on your younger sibling sitting on the other side of the table, thereby earning a thunderous thud on your back by one of your parents. Not the ideal way to welcome a New Year.\n\nOr trying to be like the \u2018cool\u2019 kids in the movie Anjali , who wear sneakers inside the house, sneak out of their apartments in the middle of the night and go around the city singing songs with strangers. Boss, which Chennai kid could go out and do such a thing I just cannot imagine! I tried doing that once (it was not even New Year\u2019s Eve and it was not even midnight) and yet I was caught in the act before even moving out of the bed, for I was sleeping next to my grandmother, who slept with her eyes open. In the days before technology, my grandmother was a CCTV camera, GPS monitoring system and voice-based alarm mechanism all rolled into one.\n\nSo on December 31, at best, our apartment residents association would put up a \u2018variety show\u2019 and distribute potato chips and Rasna. So much for \u2018partying\u2019. A few years later, while in college, there were rumours about how my friend\u2019s friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s neighbours were part of this \u2018awesome\u2019 New Year party, and how they all counted down and rang in the New Year in great style. Interestingly, no one you knew directly ever went to these parties. There was also this \u2018cool gang\u2019 that boasted of having gone to Goa to party all the way through New Year\u2019s Eve. There were also terms such as \u2018farm house parties\u2019, \u2018beach house parties\u2019 thrown at us poor kids, who didn\u2019t even understand what they meant. It was all a grand mystery, and yet I badly wanted to be a part of it.\n\nWhile all my parents wanted was a simple university rank and a gold medal out of me, all I wanted was to get invited to at least one New Year party. It was around this age when the newspapers were also full of advertisements with captions such as \u2018New Year Bash\u2019 or \u2018New Year Gala\u2019. Entry for such parties was priced slightly less than the going rate for a kidney or a liver, which unfortunately were already pledged for my engineering education. It became my life\u2019s goal to attend at least one New Year party.\n\nNow, many years later, even though I earn enough to afford an occasional litre of petrol, the mysterious New Year party continues to elude me. A few days back, I came across another ad that said \u2018New Year\u2019s eve midnight dinner buffet\u2019 and my first thought was, \u2018Who in their right mind eats dinner buffet at midnight?\u2019 A few seconds later, my second thought was \u2018OK, I have to go to this buffet now\u2019. I decided to splurge and called up the fine-dining restaurant to reserve a table for two. The manager promised me a table at 10 p.m. sharp on December 31, 2018. I laughingly appreciated his sense of humour, to which he replied, with the seriousness of a cardiac-surgeon, that their restaurant was booked for the next two years.\n\nWhat?! Who are these strange human beings who reserve dinner tables two years in advance? I politely cancelled my reservation and decided to try other places for mediocre mass-cooked food and diluted drinks at hyper-inflated prices. I received a similar response everywhere. People had already signed up to spend unnecessary amounts of money, thereby denying me the chance to do the same.\n\nSo, I am waiting as the earth begins one more revolution around the sun. Hopefully, next year, I will be invited to a \u2018New Year Gala Bash.\u2019 And while we wait for another 365 days, here\u2019s wishing everyone a great laughter-filled 2017.\n\nThe Local Tea Party is a popular blogger from Chennai, known for his quirky prose.

For the first time in recent memory, the number of memorable new shows this year far outstripped the number of new films released.\n\nSome fear this embarrassment of riches on television cannot be sustained. A recent study by FX, an American cable channel, revealed that the number of shows in the US increased by 94 per cent from 2009 to 2015. This growth is now being driven largely by streaming services such as Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video, all of which have invested heavily in producing original content. According to Janney, a financial services firm, Netflix set aside $5 billion for producing original content in 2016.\n\nIndian viewers, of course, could barely be less pleased \u2014 after all, both Netflix and Amazon Video arrived this year. Even as we rejoice and look forward to more in 2017, here is a look at some of the shows that captivated us in 2016:\n\nPlanet Earth II\n\nIt is hard to believe David Attenborough is 90. His distinct voice \u2014 with its signature crackle \u2014 permeates the second coming of BBC\u2019s Planet Earth . It has been ten years since the last edition enthralled viewers. Much has changed in the world since then, Attenborough informs us. It is much more fragile; much more in need of appreciation and conservation. Planet Earth II goes beyond the previous show \u2014 which itself had gone far beyond anything that came before it \u2014 in order to show us the magnificence of the natural world. (It was filmed in three years by a camera crew of 22 in 40 countries.) Across six episodes, steered by Attenborough\u2019s authoritative narration, Planet Earth II transcends the medium and shows us a planet of immense richness, and a heart-breakingly uncertain future. Frequently, we are chastened by the realisation that, in the struggle for survival, our planet can be unforgivingly cruel too.\n\nFleabag\n\nThe best television drama of the year is also the shortest. At about 162 minutes, which really is feature-film length, Fleabag is eminently viewable in a single dash. Phoebe Waller-Bridge must certainly be the find of the year. She directs, writes (the show is an adaption of her own play), and also acts as the eponymous Fleabag \u2014 an obnoxious, conflicted misfit who struggles to find her feet in London after a personal tragedy.\n\nDeceptively simple, yet layered, Fleabag offers a wealth of vantage points. At the level of comedy, the gags are fresh, occasionally uncomfortable, and mostly dark in their humour. The digs come fast and furious \u2014 at straitjacketed family life; at familial relationships; at men who consider women beneath them; at women who accept infidelity, and find themselves paralysed by inaction. The most devastating indictment remains for Fleabag, who must make peace with her own horridness.\n\nFull Frontal with Samantha Bee\n\nFull Frontal with Samantha Bee is unique for being a news comedy show hosted by a woman. Right at the beginning of the first episode, Bee fields questions from men: \u201cIs it hard breaking into the boys\u2019 club? What does it feel like being a woman on a late night show?\u201d These questions in themselves answer what a break from tradition this show is\u2014and, indeed, how important.\n\nSamantha Bee was the longest-tenured correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. She brings her mighty experience to her own show, but wears it with lightness. The witty one-liners fly off her sleeve; more devastating are the moments of exposition taken entirely from real news footage. Unlike other late night shows, Bee takes a hard look at women\u2019s issues consistently \u2014 from abortion laws, to the long-suffering wives of politicians, to Kansas\u2019s dress code for women in the Senate (\u201cyour state\u2019s got 99 problems, but a bitch ain\u2019t one\u201d). Along with Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Krysten Ritter (Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones), Samantha Bee makes up the triumvirate of excellence in television. If recent shows are any indication, gone are the days, hopefully, of women playing second fiddle, or, at best, one of an ensemble. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , which shares the studio with the show, at last has a worthy, and necessary, compatriot.\n\nAtlanta\n\nIt\u2019s likely that half-way into the first episode of Atlanta , viewers might \u2014 with some guilt \u2014 note that it\u2019s very hard to spot a single white character in the show. By the end of the first season, that feeling becomes a distant memory, and one revels in the feeling of having watched something quite original and edifying. Atlanta is a perceptive look at the struggles of two African-American rappers to make it in America. It wears its identity lightly but never turns away from issues that matter \u2014police brutality, internet trolling, mental illness and the never-ending quest for love.\n\nHere\u2019s an exercise: try thinking of the most popular shows of the last 20 years. Chosen at random, one would arrive at perhaps the following: Seinfeld, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, The West Wing, How I Met Your Mother . Atlanta holds its own against the best, and is another nail in the coffin for TV shows run by white men. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s written and directed by Donald Glover, who plays one of the two leads. Watch out for him in next year\u2019s Spiderman: Homecoming , and the under-production Han Solo Star Wars film.\n\nThe Night Manager\n\nTom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie star in a six-episode cat-and-mouse thriller\u2014an adaptation of John le Carre\u2019s 1993 novel of the same name. Fans of Hiddleston and Laurie (who isn\u2019t?) barely need to be persuaded to watch the show. For those who aren\u2019t, it\u2019s a showcase for both men\u2019s considerable acting talents and should win them new admirers. The basic plot is trite (seeking revenge for the death of a loved one by infiltrating an arms dealer\u2019s inner circle) and has seen multiple iterations over the years. But sharp, edge-of-the-seat writing, gorgeous camera-work, and the two leading men elevate the source material.\n\nHiddleston, as the hurt lover, broods quietly, biding his time to pounce upon Laurie, the egregious arms dealer. Laurie, for his part, ensconced in his outrageously beautiful villa (or is it a fortress?) in Spain, perfects a swagger that accompanies a steel-cold heart. One of the stars of the show (to the delight of Fleabag fans) is Olivia Colman, who plays a pregnant intelligence officer. Perfectly cast as the obnoxious stepmother in Fleabag , she offers a strong case for being cast in more shows.\n\nAlso Watch Stranger Things, The Crown, Westworld, Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones, The Night Of.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967703.ece/BINARY/31bgmTVstory_GG+GHE12F0VG.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Shubhodeep Pal"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Idiot-box-no-more/article16967707.ece", "title": "Idiot box no more"}, {"text": "California-based rapper-songwriter Svetha Rao, was in Bengaluru as part of her music tour.

Claire Foy is stunning as a young woman with an immense burden on her shoulders. The show is visually arresting, tightly-scripted and is proof that story-telling is, and always will be, superior to big-budget special effects. (Netflix)\n\nWestworld : What happens when robots created for human pleasure discover consciousness? Worse, what happens when they realise the magnitude of the abuse they\u2019ve been put through? A mind-bending storyline with equally confounding twists and a cast that reads like an honour roll, no show this year is capable of making you stay up at night the way Westworld does. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nStranger Things : The Eighties are back with this eerie sci-fi mystery that plays like a Stephen King novel. Stranger Things boasts of not only Winona Ryder (who is flawless as a distraught mother trying to make sense of aliens in her backyard), but also the most lovable 10-year-olds in recent television history. (Netflix)\n\nThe Night Of: Dark and gripping, The Night Of is, to borrow from the show, a subtle beast. Naz Khan finds himself accused of a gory murder, and it doesn\u2019t help that he has no recollection of events. Riz Ahmed, John Turturro and Bill Camp are fantastic in this courtroom drama that makes no mince of discussing racial prejudice and Islamophobia in the backdrop of the American justice system. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nThe Night Manager : John le Carre\u2019s riveting espionage novel is brought to life by this lavish BBC production, which has some sublime acting performances. Hugh Laurie transforms into Richard \u2018The Worst Man In The World\u2019 Roper, a billionaire weapons dealer, and Olivia Colman is brilliant as Angela Burr, the determined British enforcement agent who\u2019s out to catch him. As for Tom Hiddleston, the show may as well be one which cements his place as the next James Bond.\n\nGame of Thrones (Season 6) : The sixth season of Game of Thrones premi\u00e8red this year, with each episode having a bigger revelation than the next. With resurrections, family reunions and sweet revenge, the season was probably the fastest moving in terms of storyline after the first, and the final episodeswere masterpieces. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story : This miniseries that swept the Emmys this year resurrects the real courtroom drama of the infamous murder trial that shook 90s America. The screenplay will have you on the edge of your seat. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nBlack Mirror : The show is a compilation of six episodes, each narrating a different (horror) story detailing our relationships, and growing reliance on technology. Whether it\u2019s the story of killer robotic bees or a future where your worth is measured in \u2018likes\u2019, Black Mirror will have you looking at your phones very differently. (Netflix)\n\nBetter Call Saul (Season 2) : The show might be only two seasons old, but the spin-off has already outdone its much-celebrated original, Breaking Bad . The series about a small-time lawyer\u2019s path to becoming an ace con-man has excellent story-telling, sharp dialogue, terrific acting, and is one of the best shows on TV right now. (Colors Infinity)\n\nThe Americans (Season 4) : The thriller series about two Russian spies living average American lives during the peak of the Cold War only got better this year. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys give extraordinary performances, yet again, as the show dives deeper into the complex themes of identity, patriotism and family, with a few wigs thrown in.

Higgins\u2026 the list of foreigners who evinced a deep interest in the classical arts of India and became regulars at the annual music festival in Madras is long and impressive. But who was the first to come? That honour must go to Mrs. Stan Harding. A hard-bitten journalist, she was an active participant in The Music Academy\u2019s 1931 music conference.\n\nThat was the first year that The Music Academy was holding its annual conference in a pandal behind the Ripon Building, at a location somewhere close to My Ladye\u2019s Garden. A frisson of excitement must have gone through the audience of assembled representatives of Madras society, for Mrs. Harding was no ordinary journalist; she had been arrested in Soviet Russia 11 years earlier, on charges of being a British spy.\n\nThat was in June 1920, when as the correspondent of the New York World , Mrs. Harding had just landed in Russia, with the full permission of the Soviet Government. On arrival in Moscow, she was thrown into prison on charges of espionage. A summary trial three days later had her condemned to penal servitude.\n\nFive months in confinement followed, during which she was repeatedly offered freedom, provided she consented to act as a Soviet spy and propagandist. She however declined and remained incarcerated \u2018under atrocious conditions\u2019. Relief was not long in coming, for Britain made her release a pre-condition to its entering into a Trade Agreement with the Soviets.\n\nOn release, she filed for compensation, with the full backing of the British Government. The then Foreign Secretary and former Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, was in charge of the diplomatic arm-twisting. The Soviets paid up 3,000 pounds in 1923. It was also eventually discovered that her arrest was entirely due to another journalist \u2014 Marguerite Harrison of the American Press , who also doubled as a spy for her country. There was a strong feeling in the U.K. that compensation ought to be sought from the U.S. as well, but that was never pursued. A book on her experiences was released in 1925.\n\nMrs. Harding\u2019s visit to Madras was in far happier circumstances. She had come to make a film on the Devadasi tradition of Madras Presidency, and her timing could not have been better. The entire region was in the throes of Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy\u2019s Anti-Nautch Bill. Mrs. Harding presented a paper on the Devadasis at The Music Academy\u2019s conference, and from what little has been documented of it, we can see that she was no stranger to our city. She had come 20 years earlier and she commented that the costumes worn by the courtesans in 1911 were completely different to those of 1931.\n\nIt is not clear if Mrs. Harding ever made her film, and whether if done, it has been preserved.

Being a dancer, ardent traveller and foodie, I probably ignored the small symptoms, assuming I was tired or lacked sleep. But after having bought a luxury car, I had taken my parents on a long road trip from Bangalore all the way to Varkala in Kerala via Coorg. The onward journey was spread over 10 days, with enough breaks, but the return was a continuous drive with short breaks for lunch and tea. After reaching Bangalore, I felt fatigued for two weeks, which seemed very unusual; before I could get to my physician, I had fallen sick with chills. My temperature wouldn\u2019t come down, and then after multiple tests, my physician asked me to get admitted immediately. I was diagnosed with both CKD and hypertension; the doctors couldn\u2019t figure what triggered what. Due to the possibility of bleeding, a biopsy was ruled out and my adventure with something that I never expected began.\n\nTo cut a long story short, four hours of dialysis three times a week, needles being pricked every alternate day, painfully, in the same spot, a strict salt-less diet, huge quantities of medicines that seemed like a meal by itself, long waits, multiple visits to hospitals, umpteen number of tests, injections, procedures, sleepless nights due to breathlessness, and to top it all, my medical insurance had expired a few weeks ago, and I had to use up all my savings. But I had a lot of emotional help from family and friends. While I was going through all this physically, emotionally and mentally there was just one thing I could think of \u2014 being positive, getting over this as soon as possible, and getting back to this wonderful adventure called life. The only thing that was a constant, was my smile and my zest for life. I would never let that change for anything. My parents, sister, family and friends were very worried, but I guess seeing me being cool and accepting of my condition, kind of changed it for them. Three years on, nine months ago, I had the good fortune of getting a kidney transplant done through the State-run cadaver donor programme called the ZCCK (Zonal Coordination Committee of Karnataka). After 12 days of isolation in the hospital and six months of rest at home, I have recovered. There are a few ups and downs, but life is back to normal.\n\nI turned 40 this year, and I had to put this behind me. Everyone says life begins at 40, and for me, it truly did. My 40th birthday was the first day of the rest of my life, and I had to celebrate and share that special day with my family and friends. I had a very quirky, fun invite designed by a dear friend, and yes, the celebrations were special because nearly 100 of my friends turned up at my farm, from all across, including Chennai and Delhi.\n\nI have already ticked Cuba, which has been on my bucket list for the past 24 years from the time I got exposed to the dance form of salsa. Little did I know then, that I would take it up as a profession and this would actually lead me to a place where salsa evolved. From the word go, all we did was dance to live salsa bands playing music in every restaurant, caf\u00e9 and street corner; enjoyed all the Cuban rum, Cuban cigars, driving around classic cars, taking up an excruciating trek in the Escambray Mountain ranges to test my mettle (I was exhausted but just had to do it). The experience of dancing salsa in Cuba is truly one of a kind, and then being complimented by the lead singer of the Buena Vista Social Club, who said, \u2018I dance like a Cuban\u2019, was truly the highlight of the trip. I guess all this was possible only because I knew I had a lot of unfinished business and had to bounce out of my illness really quick.\n\nBecause I was undergoing dialysis for a long time, my lung function had reduced drastically, and I had to get it back to optimal functioning, So I was under constant care and scrutiny by my medical team of nephrologists, pulmonologists and cardiologists. I also took up BKS Iyengar Yoga, Cross fit, daily walks in the morning and had to get professional help to get on a perfect diet.\n\nAnother item on my bucket list that I managed was the Ziro Festival of Music in Arunachal Pradesh and two memorable trips to Kolkata. Now, I am looking forward to Iceland in March 2017, Colombia, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic in October 2017. More importantly, my perception of life has changed. I have always been on a quest to find the \u2018reason\u2019 why I was put on the planet, and after this crazy experience, I think I have found purpose, along with the need to live a full life. My message to everybody is: Always be aware and listen to your body and live every day like it\u2019s your last.\n\nDuring my days of dialysis, I was exposed to a completely different world. I met people who could not afford dialysis, people who took the train every night to Bangalore to get a dialysis done for years on end, people who passed up the opportunity to live a good life because they didn\u2019t have the money for a transplant. Having experienced this, I had to do something about it, and launched the Spreading Hope campaign, for which I will be driving from Puducherry to Ladakh over a month, touching nine cities and surrounding rural areas to spread the message of preventive care through talks, seminars, free tests and awareness on organ donation.\n\nIf you know anyone who is going through CKD and would like to speak to the writer, reach out at lourdvijay@gmail.com .\n\nBeing complimented by the lead singer of the Buena Vista Social Club, who said, \u2018I dance like a Cuban\u2019, was truly the highlight of the trip", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16952153.ece/BINARY/28mp_ididit_G6J+GAS121A5I.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/%E2%80%98Life-begins-at-40%E2%80%99/article16967700.ece", "title": "\u2018Life begins at 40\u2019"}, {"text": "Watch\n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve\n\nA noisy party not your cup of tea?

Like always, such grandeur of envisioning a world vast and beyond always leaves me heavy in the throes of an existential crisis. That or the lack of a 4G network \u2013 both.\n\nIn the midst of all those \u2018why are we here\u2019 and \u2018what does it all matter\u2019 questions, I can\u2019t help but wonder about the pettiness that we occupy ourselves with. How we allow ourselves to fall for beliefs and notions that are nothing but a man-made construct. Religion. Time. Money. And somewhere down the pecking order, the belief that whisky is superior to whiskey.\n\nNow, we understand the purist\u2019s obsession with single malts and the special scoff they reserve for anything that isn\u2019t. One is also not entirely unfamiliar with the new, almost-hipster Bourbon brigade, who put down the Scotch enthusiasts like an endangered species. And let\u2019s not forget the new-age revolutionaries who will back any whisky (or whiskey) as long as it comes from a seemingly obscure country: India. Iceland. Italy. Even France! How about Tasmania down under?\n\nBut we often forget a country that sits on the cusp of all these factions: Irish whiskey. While it is true that most famous Irish distilleries were set up by Scotsmen, let\u2019s not forget that, historically, the art of distilling was brought by Irish monks to the Gaelic Bravehearts in the first place.\n\nThat said, the Irish style of whiskey is unique and very different from any else found around the world. To generalise, Scotch tends to be smoky and toasty, and Bourbon, at the other end of the spectrum, leans towards vanilla and butterscotch, and most other styles (Japanese and such) emulate one of the two with the local weather and master blender providing the nuanced differentiation.\n\nIrish whiskey then, by the same generalisation, is fairly neutral. It is smooth without being toasty, fruity without being ripe. It doesn\u2019t do peat, nor does it do new charred casks. Their idea of whiskey is to make a flavourful easy beverage that does well by itself and also marries well in cocktails. It should appeal to the novice, but also have complexity enough to engage the seasoned tippler. Recently, I was privy to an extended tasting by a popular Irish whiskey brand, Jameson, and these notes are pretty much from my scribbles on that evening.\n\nBut flavour aside, what I really like about them is how they have chosen to reach out to their patrons: no stuffy tastings, no elaborate meal pairings, or men in kilts being paraded through banquets full of thirsty aficionados. Instead, they are looking at more contemporary events and animations to engage people. Even an underground music fest was fair ground for them! Who would have thought that one day we would be enjoying the up-tempo beats of top international DJs with a measure of Jameson and ginger ale?\n\nAnd that is precisely how we should take life: always ready for the unexpected. To enjoy each unanticipated moment without classifying or judging. And as long as the glass has a double pour in it, don\u2019t worry whether it\u2019s whisky or whiskey.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967676.ece/BINARY/31mp_magan.ART_+G39125FDS.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Magandeep Singh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/A-matter-of-E/article16967678.ece", "title": "A matter of E"}, {"text": "Shahid and Mira Kapoor will be the second couple onKoffee with KaranSeason 5 after Akshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna.

It was taken with a webcam that was slightly bigger than a ping-pong ball, and whose resolution was poorer than the camera of the cheapest phone you get today. But the fact that you could take your own picture at the click of the mouse was mighty exciting, and so, purely in memory of those happy days, I have retained that picture on my blog, even though I barely resemble the man in it.\n\nThereafter, I took countless other selfies with the conventional camera, especially when wife and I would travel: I would put one arm around her and hold the camera with the other, pointing the lens in our direction and \u2014 with some mental calculation \u2014 making sure we were in the frame. Since we couldn\u2019t see ourselves on the display screen, we did not adjust our hair or alter our expressions to look our best: we merely smiled and looked at the lens. Some of our happiest pictures \u2014 whether spontaneously happy or happily spontaneous, I am not sure \u2014 were self-clicked in this fashion.\n\nSo, what the kids are doing today, I have been doing for more than a decade now; only that I did not know back then that such a self-clicked photograph would soon acquire a name, recognised by even the Oxford dictionary: selfie. Needless to say, the venerated dictionary, in keeping with the changing times, defines the \u2018selfie stick\u2019 as well, that too with great clarity: \u2018A device in the form of a rod on which a camera or a smartphone may be mounted, enabling the person holding it to take a photograph of themselves from a wider angle than if holding the camera or smartphone in their hand.\u2019\n\nSelfies are a way of life today. Many of us aren\u2019t even sure whether we live to selfie \u2014 or selfie to live? I have taken the liberty to use selfie as a verb because that\u2019s how it is, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the smartphone-owning society is split into two these days: people who live healthy so that they look naturally good when selfies are taken, and people who feel healthy when their selfies earn widespread admiration on social media.\n\nI don\u2019t know which category I belong to, but I would certainly find it very worrisome if I appeared to be \u2018smart\u2019 and \u2018fit\u2019 \u2014 even if not so in real life \u2014 with the help of the lens. The lens is capable of lying through its teeth, provided you know in which angle to hold the phone: a tubby man, therefore, can look trim \u2014 and once the \u2018likes\u2019 start pouring in, he actually begins to believe that he is in great shape when he isn\u2019t.\n\nWe now live in a world of illusions \u2014 or maya \u2014 something that the sages had always cautioned us against: a protruding tummy looks flat, whereas a perfect pair of feminine lips protrudes. Tonight, when you go partying, no matter where you go, look around: you will find countless pairs of lips protruding as the cameras are turned into the selfie mode \u2014 that is, if you are already not among those who like to pout.\n\nThe practice has become so common that no one any longer bats an eyelid when they find a young woman suddenly stopping in the middle of anywhere and aiming the phone at herself to pout at the screen. As for the woman, during those few moments she spends clicking selfies, she becomes so oblivious to the people around her, as if she were in front of the restroom mirror.\n\nBut: why pout when clicking a selfie? That, to me, shall remain the unanswered question from 2016, even as I wish you a Happy 2017.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967691.ece/BINARY/31mpBG.ART_GRA1+GPH12ACT1.2.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Bishwanath Ghosh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Happy-2017-But-why-do-you-pout/article16967692.ece", "title": "Happy 2017!

What are those small changes that would make our home a touch cosier and more streamlined? I\u2019ve noted down three key resolutions. Let\u2019s call them \u201cspacelutions\u201d for the fun of it, shall we? And the best part about house and home resolutions is you don\u2019t have to stop eating chocolate to achieve any of them!\n\nDeclutter\n\nStart by assessing all that you currently own and that\u2019s on display. Be it vases, photo frames, knick knack bowls, candles, and more. Once you take stock of it all, it becomes easier to cull what you truly want to keep. I love to pepper my living room with photos, but I do always make a mental note to keep it in check, so it doesn\u2019t make the space overwhelming. Similarly, maybe you don\u2019t need to display all your showpieces at once. Choose your current favourite and make that your star piece.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your key d\u00e9cor elements in place, vow to clean up those drawers that hold forgotten notes, old bills, bookmarks, medicines and more. Make catch-all baskets and trinket trays your best friend. Streamlining spaces that are visible is easy enough. But only once those little nooks and crannies are spruced up too do you feel like you can tick this resolution off your new year to-do list.\n\nStay get-together ready, always\n\nAt the turn of the new year, each of us vow to put in effort into spending quality time with our loved ones. So why not lend your home space that inviting feel? Starting in the new year, vow to make every living space get-together and guest-friendly. Small and simple changes help you achieve this in the most seamless of ways. Make sure that vase in your living room always has a bunch of fresh flowers. Take stock of old magazines that tend to pile up in the bathroom or bedroom and stow them away to give to the old paper mart. This helps in keeping your home clutter-free ever so often. Ensure you always have a clean set of bed and bath linen ready in the guest bedroom in case a relative pops by for a short stay. I also always fluff and switch up my couch and floor cushions so that they\u2019re always a tad lived-in and not entirely stiff for when guests pop over.\n\nKeep your d\u00e9cor elements seasonal\n\nIf you keep flowers at your foyer, apart from the year-round rotation of roses, orchids, and lilies, switch up and opt for flowers that are seasonal. Similarly for scented candles \u2013 in the summers, opt for tropical and sunny scents; maybe even choose tropical-inspired pieces to go with. Pick rain forest-esque scents for the monsoon and pine and cinnamon for the winters for that cosy, toasty feel. Doing this helps in bringing in and reflecting the current season indoors too.\n\nThe simplest things make the most impact. These are just three of many quick things you can do to get closer to a more \u2018spacelution\u2019-friendly home; one that is more inviting, more seasonal and definitely more clutter-free!\n\nHave a sparkling 2017!", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967679.ece/BINARY/31mp_sussanne.A+GRQ1259IC.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Sussanne Khan Is Style Editor At The Label Life"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Housekeeping-tips/article16967681.ece", "title": "Housekeeping tips"}, {"text": "Bring on the bling\n\nIf you\u2019re the kind that loves some sparkle and shine, there\u2019s no better day than New Year\u2019s Eve to wear a metallic dress.

This was it. Race day. My high-strung body clock had sent a surge of wake-up signals a few minutes before the alarm was set to go off. With the country having pushed back the clock in the small hours, as daylight saving time ceded way to fall and winter\u2019s Eastern Standard Time, I had gained an invaluable extra hour of fitful sleep, and now set about the race-day morning routine \u2014 a large cup of black coffee to accompany a small breakfast, an apparel and gear check, and a couple of visits to the loo to try and ensure I wouldn\u2019t need to seek one for the next six hours.\n\nFinally, only half convinced that I was in a complete state of readiness, I set off with my sister \u2014 she was to drop me off at the start-line staging area \u2014 to Fort Wadsworth. While the race was scheduled to start only at 9.50 a.m., for those of us who were in Wave 1, we still needed to get there at least 90 minutes before time to pass security and reach our respective corrals. With almost 52,000 runners set to start the world\u2019s biggest-ever marathon (by number of participants), the staging area was like one large carnival ground, overflowing with neon-coloured humanity from all parts of the globe. I soon found my starting corral and I threaded my way past several empty, and even some occupied, sleeping bags (most likely runners who had got in on the first ferry from Manhattan and were going to start in Wave 2 or 3 and looking to catch up on some lost sleep). I noticed a dumpster, meant for outerwear that one might want to discard. Without a second thought, I peeled off my Puma jacket and tossed it in, feeling warm on the outside from the bright morning sunlight and glowy on the inside from what felt like a heroic act of spontaneous generosity. I realised my folly almost immediately. The enclosure\u2019s waiting area was in the shadow of two large buildings, where the temperature was a blustery couple of degrees cooler.\n\nAfter what seemed an interminable wait, we moved as a herd, till in about half a mile we were on the ramp leading to the upper deck of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, poised for the start. Only then did the significance of the moment hit me. NYPD and television helicopters hovered overhead, their rotors chattering, drowning out my excited and nervous heartbeat: I was about to begin my maiden New York Marathon, poorly prepared to achieve the goal that had first spurred me to seek an entry to this prestigious World Major some six months earlier. Instead of ticking all the boxes over the preceding 18 weeks of my training plan, I had just about got in a fifth of the targeted workouts, some measly mileage and no hill training whatsoever for the up and down bridge-filled course that lay ahead. The boom from the Marine Corps cannon cut short my train of anxious thoughts, and off we all went, jostling each other along, as the river of humanity spilled over the start mat. All around me I heard the morse-like volley of beeps, as timing chips were registered, Garmin watches turned on. Runners shortened their strides to keep from bumping into each other. Nearing the midpoint of the bridge, I threw a glance out to sea, and there was Lady Liberty in the distance, bright green in the morning sun. As our pace quickened on the downhill, I knew this would be a special day.\n\nOver the 26.2 miles of the race, we would weave in and out of the five boroughs \u2014 Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx \u2014 before cresting the finishing chute in Central Park. Spirits buoyed by thousands of cheering New Yorkers: brass bands, impromptu rock music, and the FDNY stations that clanged their bells in encouragement, I summoned the will to drive my aching feet towards the finish line.

And the hair stays natural with a messy pulled-back look,\u201d begins Krishna Mukhi, stylist and former Fashion Features Director atHarper\u2019s Bazaar India.\n\nHere\u2019s breaking down the dress code for the night ahead:\n\nVelvet reloaded: Metal and velvet \u2014 you could do either one or both. High-octane glamour from Balmain, Gucci and Givenchy make the cut this season, but if you are partial to Indian designers, Huemn, the inventive Rajesh Pratap Singh and Atsu are the labels to hunt down. \u201cHuemn did \u201880s nostalgia very well at fashion weeks this year, with distinctive fur accents,\u201d continues Krishna. At the online fashion address, Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop, the label\u2019s black-and-gold cutdana embroidered gown, at Rs. 65,500, is a keeper. Meanwhile, the store\u2019s founder, Pernia Qureshi, also votes for Atsu\u2019s panelled, lace-up and one-shoulder wrap dresses in black. \u201cAtsu\u2019s clothes are feminine and chic and they fit like a glove. Both he and Shivan & Narresh did their best collection at Lakme this year,\u201d she insists. Her website has had many takers for Shivan & Narresh\u2019s palazzos with gold skein work.\n\nBerry fantastic: Blackest blackcurrant it is. Deep, dark and dramatic hues were undeniably the biggest trend for lips this season, and Krishna references the berry-like mouths on show at Rodarte, Marni and Erdem. \u201cMany of our Indian designers did it too, but the most striking of all were the lacquered black-cherry pouts at Louis Vuitton and Dior, the latter created with Dior\u2019s Rouge Dior in Poison coated with Dior Addict Ultra Gloss for a mirror finish. My personal favourite, though, is MAC\u2019s Cyber,\u201d she adds.\n\nFor the eyes, glitter and metallic updates are inevitable in the corner of the eye or near the cheekbones, but we\u2019re betting on the berry eye (wine shades) seen on Emanuel Ungaro\u2019s models at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year.\n\nBoots on board: You can\u2019t take thigh-high boots and slits out of the party circuit, but chunky platforms and strappy feminine sandals are definitely in. \u201cIf you plan to go partying in flats, they must have an element of glamour, with jewelled or faux leather detail. There is baroque too, toned down,\u201d says Krishna, pulling out images of velvet loafers from Miu Miu.\n\nInstant shine : For pocket-friendly last-minute purchases, like Bansri\u2019s body harness or Outhouse\u2019s chokers, try Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop and multi-designer stores like Amethyst and Evoluzione.\n\nMen\u2019s style\n\nJacket check : \u201cCarry the right attitude. This is the best accessory any man can ever possess!\u201d is sartorial savant Rohit Bal\u2019s blunt advice to our party-ready man. Some cajoling later, \u201cIt depends on what kind of party it is. I would suggested fitted and flared anarkali shapes under a sherwani or a long jacket for an occasion. A well-fitted leather jacket made to your size is a must-have. You can carry it off in a number of ways.\u201d Another winner, Huemn\u2019s bomber jackets from Amazon India Fashion Week in October.\n\nThe custom suit : Borrow a few pointers on dressing sharp from Mumbai\u2019s suit expert, Troy Costa \u2013 everyone from actor Aamir Khan to Randeep Hooda is a fan. Someone else who swears by the \u201cbest to be overdressed rather than underdressed\u201d rule is Abhishek Paatni, the only new-age designer invited to showcase at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights this month. \u201cA custom peak lapel velvet blazer with a cotton shirt and pants would be my party look. To accessorise, throw in a lapel pin and a square. A nice pair of Oxford shoes in patent leather will complete your look,\u201d he promises.\n\nMale metallic: While tweed, wool, leather, suede and scuba will continue to rock the dance floor, Rajesh Pratap Singh\u2019s metal jacket is the most defining look of 2016. Check out artist Subodh Gupta in the \u2018steel\u2019 suit if you need convincing.\n\nMind the extras: Shantanu & Nikhil revived brooches for men, but in an edgier avatar, at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights. The magazine\u2019s editor, Che Kurrien, says Tom Ford\u2019s reinvention of a classic fragrance, the Tobacco Vanille, wins hands down this season. And for some quirk, he suggests you take the Adidas Originals Tubular X sneakers for a spin tonight. Top photographer and Kingfisher Calendar man, Atul Kasbekar, insists on self-tied bow ties, if you are going formal. \u201cTom Ford has a brilliant pre-tied bow that looks like you\u2019ve knotted it. And because it\u2019s so cool, it costs 175 pounds at Selfridges!\u201d he concludes.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967682.ece/BINARY/Text-28-12-2016+G2G125IC4.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Rosella Stephen"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Through-the-cocktail-hour/article16967760.ece", "title": "Through the cocktail hour"}, {"text": "Past in ruins(Clockwise from above) The ruins at the site, the lion statue, headless statues of the owners of Cleopatra's (not the Queen, only a namesake) house\n\nWe stagger on to the sands from the steamer, glad of firm land beneath our feet. The ride from the largest Cycladic Greek island of Naxos (430 sq. km.) to perhaps the smallest one, Delos (3.4 sq. km.) has been rocky. But we are glad the lovely island of Delos, once a holy spot, and now a World Heritage site, is well-supplied with information boards.\n\nAt the height of its prosperity \u2013 in the Archaic (800 to 480 BC) and Classical (500 to 336 BC ) periods \u2013 this tiny island had people converging from all over Greece to pay their respects to Apollo, the god of balance, light and harmony. Goddess Leto is supposed to have sought refuge here to give birth to him and his twin sister Artemis, the moon goddess, to escape the wrath of Zeus\u2019 lawful wife. The whole island is now an archaeological museum, containing the remains of mighty buildings and temples. One can almost feel the hustle and bustle of ships coming in to trade, and hear the sacred chants.\n\nWe halt in front of the once-magnificent temple to Apollo. His Kouros (nude male) image was a towering 30 ft. presence before pirates and foes took a toll.\n\nIn the Classical period, those in power competed in constructing temples, meeting places (agoras) and roofed colonnades (stoas). Later, to ensure the island\u2019s purity, nobody was allowed to be born or die here. A natural harbour ensured its prominence as a centre of trade. After the Romans came to the island, they decided to make it a free port in 166 B.C. This signalled the beginning of a rush, with merchants, aristocrats and ship owners making Delos their destination. The island became a thriving centre of slave trade .\n\nMansions with beautiful tiles and frescoes took shape. The mansions had frescoes of gay-looking dolphins and of Dionysus, the god of wine. The excavations enable us to look at the luxury that once was \u2013 the houses with wonderful courtyards and rooms, including those built for the slaves.\n\nEarlier, passing by the now-dry sacred lake and then making our way along the sacred way, we sight statues of mean-looking lions, a gift from the islanders of Naxos in 600 BC.\n\nThe dozen lions have been reduced to five now at the site: these are replicas, with the original statues baring their teeth forever in stone at the nearby museum.\n\nThe terrace of lions leads us to the spectacular columned forum built by the merchants of Beirut to establish their trade.\n\nThe common man and his occupations are revealed by the ruins of a bakery and pub on the opposite side of the road. So vivid are the descriptions here that we can almost smell the aroma of bread and see the wine sparkling in giant terracotta beakers.\n\nThe compact museum houses many of the statues found at the site, including the remnants of Apollo\u2019s Kourus, and the lions. We then huff and puff our way up the hill to the entrance to Egyptian and Syrian temples, and on the way down sight the remains of the temple to Hera. We are unable to make it to Cleopatra\u2019s house (no, not the queen, just a similar name), or to the temple to Dionysus.\n\nMaking our way back to the steamer, we collect our sea-stricken tour mates resting below a ruined structure. They recover completely by the time we reach the cheerful touristy island of Mykonos. But understandably, neither Poseidon, the god of the sea, nor Apollo, the god of balance and harmony, is especially popular with them \u2014 then or long after.\n\nThe whole island is now an archaeological museum", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967761.ece/BINARY/31mp_Kausalya.A+GVR12C4JL.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Discovering-Delos/article16967764.ece", "title": "Discovering Delos"}, {"text": "Divya Sathyaraj believes playing a sport can be a fun alternative to spending boring hours at the gym. \u201cMost of my patients believe dieting and exercising are mutually exclusive\u2026 that you needn\u2019t diet if you exercise and vice versa,\u201d says the nutritionist and daughter of actor Sathyaraj, \u201cBut the truth is you need to balance both to be fit.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019ll explain that in detail in a documentary film titled A Bit to Be Fit.

Especially when it\u2019s almost D-Day and you still haven\u2019t a clue. While it\u2019s perfectly all right to stay home and watch TV or go out for a quiet meal, there are those for whom ringing in the new year is all about loud music, partying and dancing the night away. For them, the options are plenty. But now, with everything being about trying out new adventures, there are quite a few who want a more exclusive experience. For them, we list the five most luxurious ways of celebrating the new year in Chennai.\n\nTurn to page 8\n\nFrom page 1\n\nFitfor a king\n\nHow about booking the most expensive room in the city? Sounds great, but here\u2019s a word of advice: You may need to save up for it. For example, the presidential suite at The Leela Palace, one of the most expensive rooms in the city, is all yours for Rs. 2,50,000 for a night.\n\nYes, we don\u2019t blame you if you thought it was the rate for a month.\n\nAnd along with that hefty price tag come opulence and luxury. The room measures 4,842 sq. ft., and includes a master bedroom, a washroom with Jacuzzi, a second bedroom, a living room where you can entertain your guests with perhaps a bottle of Moet & Chandon from one of the three mini bars, before the party moves to the personal dining area for 10.\n\nAnd if you feel too stuffed after the party, feel free to use your private gym or pop over to your personal spa to get rid of those wine cramps.\n\nSilver chairs, mother of pearl coating, silk robes and the scent of exotic flowers add to the luxe experience.\n\nSail to a new beginning\n\nSan Francisco, Dubai, Maldives... they\u2019re all big on yacht parties. Some yachts are big enough to have vintage-themed balls and masquerade dances. Sounds intriguing? There\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t try it out as well. Chennai\u2019s blue sea has more than just catamarans and speed boats bobbing about.\n\nQuite a few companies rent out yachts for get-togethers or a quiet rendezvous. Usher in your new year glamorously, lounging on one of these yachts in the Bay of Bengal, with the silver moon and crashing waves for company, and a bottle of bubbly. Abhishek Roy, who runs Blue Mile, says he\u2019s already received bookings for New Year\u2019s Eve and the first of January. Shortly, he plans to start renting out his yacht for overnight stays as well. Prices vary and usually begin at about Rs. 10,000.\n\nPamper your senses\n\nThe perfect way to welcome the new year is by treating yourself to a relaxing day at the spa. And while you\u2019re at it, might as well make it a royal experience. Why not try the Royal Bliss Package (priced at Rs. 10,000 plus taxes) at Kaya Kalp at ITC Grand Chola then? One of the most expensive spa treatments in town, the 150-minute session promises to leave you feeling rejuvenated. With an ayurvedic exfoliation, a Kaya Kalp massage and a deep cleaning facial, this spa treatment is for hotel guests and members only.\n\nThe guest is welcomed with a special drink made with ginger, lemon and basil leaf, before the signature treatment begins with a luxury foot ritual with rose petals, a sea salt scrub and an ayurvedic red sandal scrub to squeeze out dead skin. This is followed by the Kaya Kalp massage and a deep cleaning facial. And by the time you\u2019re done being pampered, there\u2019s some refreshment and herbal tea to look forward to.\n\nNow that\u2019s a day well spent.\n\nRoyal repast\n\nWhy must your celebrations end with New Year\u2019s Eve? Let the party continue on January 1 as well, as you take your loved one for a romantic dinner overlooking the Bay of Bengal at Vivanta by Taj \u2013 Fisherman\u2019s Cove. Called Watch Tower Dining, the meal can be arranged only upon prior reservation. According to the hotel, the Watch Tower redefines intimacy with a captivating experience on the white sands. The experience begins the moment the guest arrives at the hotel, and is met by a charming cart to be driven to the venue. A personal butler receives you with a welcome drink and shell garlands, before helping you get comfortable in the machan overlooking the bay. What follows is an exclusive four-course meal, customised for you by the chef. It\u2019s the perfect way to get away from the maddening crowds and revel in your very own private nook. The Watch Tower dinner is priced at Rs. 30,000 plus taxes, excluding beverages.\n\nArrive in style\n\nIf you\u2019ve got luxury on your mind this New Year\u2019s, how can your ride be any less? But that certainly doesn\u2019t mean you have to burn a hole in your pocket trying to buy a fancy set of wheels. With luxury car rental services like Luxury8 and Eco Rent A Car, your options are pretty varied. According to P.N. Ranbir, manager sales at Luxury8, one of the most expensive cars in their stable is the Jaguar XJL. \u201cIt\u2019s the top-end model and is priced at Rs. 1 crore 80 lakh.\u201d But you can zip around town on this set of wheels for about Rs. 25,000 for eight hours or 80 kilometres, and with a chauffeur to boot. The car has already been booked for New Year\u2019s, according to Ranbir. And if you\u2019re looking to rent it for outstation travel, Ranbir says it can be arranged at a price of Rs. 250 per km.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967715.ece/BINARY/31komp-party.MP+G6V12BKAE.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Ranjani Rajendra", "Priyadarshini Paitandy"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Ring-in-the-new/article16967716.ece", "title": "Ring in the new"}, {"text": "\u201cThis portrait of Chandra was taken under a huge maple tree on a friend\u2019s lawn on the outskirts of New York, 1998. It is an autumn evening. The maple is aflame in the angled light from the setting sun. She picks up a leaf and holds it against the soft sun. Her eyes are awash in the russet glow. I take a quick low-angle shot, framing her against a halo of maple foliage. She\u2019s wearing a specially-tailored overcoat, made out of a Rabari (Gujarati tribal) woollen blanket. A vegetable-dyed bandhni odhni is casually tossed over her shoulder. Lavish colours of the Indian desert landscape effortlessly merge with the colours of an American Fall. Out of the hundreds of photos of Chandra I have shot, this one is suffused with an ineffable quality, a magical realism, and rates among my favourite ones.\u201dPHOTOS: Sadanand Menon, COURTESY: THE CHANDRALEKHA ARCHIVE SPACES\n\nA woman who dazzled everyone with her infectious laughter and sense of humour \u2014 that\u2019s how her friends recall Chandralekha, the late contemporary dancer and choreographer. Poet-dancer Tishani Doshi, kalaripayattu teacher Shaji K. John, and cultural commentator and her close associate, Sadanand Menon, talk about the dancer as they prepare Spaces, the performance arena by the sea, for Sharira , her last work. For them, this is not just any other performance, but a special moment to remember their dear friend on her 10th anniversary.\n\nSadanand Menon\n\nFor a boy who was brought up in a middle class/upper middle class family, Chandralekha was a complete cocking the thumb at conventionality. She used to have this infectious laughter. T. Janakiraman, the Tamil novelist, describes a woman whose laughter entered the room, before she entered. That was Chandra.\n\nHer personality was atypical. I had met many people who were kind and good. But, hardly did they have that chutzpah or that spark that she did.\n\nShe was fiercely independent. She lived alone; she mocked at people who thought of marriage. She would tell the young girls and boys who came to her dance school that it was better to get married at 60 when you needed a partner. But, all of them went ahead and got married. She would joke that the one failure in her life was that she could not convince them.\n\nWe would discuss everything. She had a fantastic library; hers was deep reading and she never mugged up.\n\nShe had a built-in crap detector that could make out the false from the truth. She could spot them easily. She did not live by any rule book. She used to say \u2018I am not clear about what to do, but I am about what not to do\u2019.\n\nShaji K. John\n\nI met Chandralekha from a state of ignorance. I was just 16 and was not aware of her philosophy or intellectual stature then. But, her disciplined lifestyle had an effect on me. I found her principles very similar to that of my gurukkal in Kerala. Qualities like punctuality and dedication, which I associated with him, were reflected in her too.\n\nHers was not a casual approach. She was completely dedicated to her work. She would get up early in the morning. She was a self-sufficient woman and also very humorous. She also valued natural resources; she would never waste water and run the motor only for five minutes. She would take care of her plants dearly, so much that she never liked people touching them.\n\nWe are doing this performance purely out of our fondness for Chandralekha. She never promoted herself; her engagement with art was not driven by an interest in money or awards. We love her as an individual, and we practised Sharira to remember her. There isn\u2019t a more beautiful way to do that.\n\nTishani Doshi\n\nThe first time Shaji asked me to meet her, I was scared. She had a small frame, but a very large personality. It felt like being called to the principal\u2019s office. But, at the very first instance, she took my hands, laughed and welcomed me.\n\nThere is a stage in your life when you are willing to be uprooted. I was at that stage. Chandra invited me into her life and put me into this production. She showed me how to live as an artiste and a woman in this country. We had many talks not just about dance, but life as well. It was a very full experience.\n\nShe could be intense, but extremely funny. She would say, \u201cWhen men lose their bodies, it is time to throw them into the ocean!\u201d There was always a sense of play. Whenever I hear a recording of her laughter, I tear up. It was very girlish and joyous. She could be forbidding and intense. But, she could also just talk about birds and love.\n\nShe was not a typical guru. It was always an equal relationship. She was a friend, family cum stranger, who you could share your life story with. She was adventurous, fearless, strong, yet open to life and involved. And, she demanded that of the people she was with.\n\n(As told to PARSHATHY J.

We went around the sun one more time. What I don\u2019t understand is, why are we celebrating it as if it is some sort of an achievement by us humans. Clearly, we didn\u2019t have a choice no? Gravity held us here and so we stayed. Otherwise, Chennai folks would have drifted off to another planet and put their kids into a \u2018strict\u2019 engineering college in Jupiter or some such. That would\u2019ve been a real achievement.\n\nBut I digress. I wanted to talk about celebrating New Year\u2019s. Or more specifically, about New Year\u2019s Eve parties. Now, if you were raised in Chennai, there is only one way of celebrating New Year\u2019s. You don\u2019t. Boss, who in their right mind spends money to usher in the New Year yaar! I understand that we have all been told people are supposed to do \u2018cool\u2019 things. Like sliding chest-down along a table like Kamal Haasan, screaming \u2018Hi everybodyyy\u2019 in S.P. Balasubrahmanyam\u2019s voice, but you only ended up crashing on your younger sibling sitting on the other side of the table, thereby earning a thunderous thud on your back by one of your parents. Not the ideal way to welcome a New Year.\n\nOr trying to be like the \u2018cool\u2019 kids in the movie Anjali , who wear sneakers inside the house, sneak out of their apartments in the middle of the night and go around the city singing songs with strangers. Boss, which Chennai kid could go out and do such a thing I just cannot imagine! I tried doing that once (it was not even New Year\u2019s Eve and it was not even midnight) and yet I was caught in the act before even moving out of the bed, for I was sleeping next to my grandmother, who slept with her eyes open. In the days before technology, my grandmother was a CCTV camera, GPS monitoring system and voice-based alarm mechanism all rolled into one.\n\nSo on December 31, at best, our apartment residents association would put up a \u2018variety show\u2019 and distribute potato chips and Rasna. So much for \u2018partying\u2019. A few years later, while in college, there were rumours about how my friend\u2019s friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s neighbours were part of this \u2018awesome\u2019 New Year party, and how they all counted down and rang in the New Year in great style. Interestingly, no one you knew directly ever went to these parties. There was also this \u2018cool gang\u2019 that boasted of having gone to Goa to party all the way through New Year\u2019s Eve. There were also terms such as \u2018farm house parties\u2019, \u2018beach house parties\u2019 thrown at us poor kids, who didn\u2019t even understand what they meant. It was all a grand mystery, and yet I badly wanted to be a part of it.\n\nWhile all my parents wanted was a simple university rank and a gold medal out of me, all I wanted was to get invited to at least one New Year party. It was around this age when the newspapers were also full of advertisements with captions such as \u2018New Year Bash\u2019 or \u2018New Year Gala\u2019. Entry for such parties was priced slightly less than the going rate for a kidney or a liver, which unfortunately were already pledged for my engineering education. It became my life\u2019s goal to attend at least one New Year party.\n\nNow, many years later, even though I earn enough to afford an occasional litre of petrol, the mysterious New Year party continues to elude me. A few days back, I came across another ad that said \u2018New Year\u2019s eve midnight dinner buffet\u2019 and my first thought was, \u2018Who in their right mind eats dinner buffet at midnight?\u2019 A few seconds later, my second thought was \u2018OK, I have to go to this buffet now\u2019. I decided to splurge and called up the fine-dining restaurant to reserve a table for two. The manager promised me a table at 10 p.m. sharp on December 31, 2018. I laughingly appreciated his sense of humour, to which he replied, with the seriousness of a cardiac-surgeon, that their restaurant was booked for the next two years.\n\nWhat?! Who are these strange human beings who reserve dinner tables two years in advance? I politely cancelled my reservation and decided to try other places for mediocre mass-cooked food and diluted drinks at hyper-inflated prices. I received a similar response everywhere. People had already signed up to spend unnecessary amounts of money, thereby denying me the chance to do the same.\n\nSo, I am waiting as the earth begins one more revolution around the sun. Hopefully, next year, I will be invited to a \u2018New Year Gala Bash.\u2019 And while we wait for another 365 days, here\u2019s wishing everyone a great laughter-filled 2017.\n\nThe Local Tea Party is a popular blogger from Chennai, known for his quirky prose.

Higgins\u2026 the list of foreigners who evinced a deep interest in the classical arts of India and became regulars at the annual music festival in Madras is long and impressive. But who was the first to come? That honour must go to Mrs. Stan Harding. A hard-bitten journalist, she was an active participant in The Music Academy\u2019s 1931 music conference.\n\nThat was the first year that The Music Academy was holding its annual conference in a pandal behind the Ripon Building, at a location somewhere close to My Ladye\u2019s Garden. A frisson of excitement must have gone through the audience of assembled representatives of Madras society, for Mrs. Harding was no ordinary journalist; she had been arrested in Soviet Russia 11 years earlier, on charges of being a British spy.\n\nThat was in June 1920, when as the correspondent of the New York World , Mrs. Harding had just landed in Russia, with the full permission of the Soviet Government. On arrival in Moscow, she was thrown into prison on charges of espionage. A summary trial three days later had her condemned to penal servitude.\n\nFive months in confinement followed, during which she was repeatedly offered freedom, provided she consented to act as a Soviet spy and propagandist. She however declined and remained incarcerated \u2018under atrocious conditions\u2019. Relief was not long in coming, for Britain made her release a pre-condition to its entering into a Trade Agreement with the Soviets.\n\nOn release, she filed for compensation, with the full backing of the British Government. The then Foreign Secretary and former Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, was in charge of the diplomatic arm-twisting. The Soviets paid up 3,000 pounds in 1923. It was also eventually discovered that her arrest was entirely due to another journalist \u2014 Marguerite Harrison of the American Press , who also doubled as a spy for her country. There was a strong feeling in the U.K. that compensation ought to be sought from the U.S. as well, but that was never pursued. A book on her experiences was released in 1925.\n\nMrs. Harding\u2019s visit to Madras was in far happier circumstances.

But some shows stood taller than the rest.\n\nHere are the 10 best shows of 2016, in no particular order.\n\nThe Crown : The Crown traces the life of a young Queen Elizabeth II, as she struggles to balance the monumental responsibility that has been thrust on her, with her once \u2018regular\u2019 life. Claire Foy is stunning as a young woman with an immense burden on her shoulders. The show is visually arresting, tightly-scripted and is proof that story-telling is, and always will be, superior to big-budget special effects. (Netflix)\n\nWestworld : What happens when robots created for human pleasure discover consciousness? Worse, what happens when they realise the magnitude of the abuse they\u2019ve been put through? A mind-bending storyline with equally confounding twists and a cast that reads like an honour roll, no show this year is capable of making you stay up at night the way Westworld does. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nStranger Things : The Eighties are back with this eerie sci-fi mystery that plays like a Stephen King novel. Stranger Things boasts of not only Winona Ryder (who is flawless as a distraught mother trying to make sense of aliens in her backyard), but also the most lovable 10-year-olds in recent television history. (Netflix)\n\nThe Night Of: Dark and gripping, The Night Of is, to borrow from the show, a subtle beast. Naz Khan finds himself accused of a gory murder, and it doesn\u2019t help that he has no recollection of events. Riz Ahmed, John Turturro and Bill Camp are fantastic in this courtroom drama that makes no mince of discussing racial prejudice and Islamophobia in the backdrop of the American justice system. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nThe Night Manager : John le Carre\u2019s riveting espionage novel is brought to life by this lavish BBC production, which has some sublime acting performances. Hugh Laurie transforms into Richard \u2018The Worst Man In The World\u2019 Roper, a billionaire weapons dealer, and Olivia Colman is brilliant as Angela Burr, the determined British enforcement agent who\u2019s out to catch him. As for Tom Hiddleston, the show may as well be one which cements his place as the next James Bond.\n\nGame of Thrones (Season 6) : The sixth season of Game of Thrones premi\u00e8red this year, with each episode having a bigger revelation than the next. With resurrections, family reunions and sweet revenge, the season was probably the fastest moving in terms of storyline after the first, and the final episodeswere masterpieces. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story : This miniseries that swept the Emmys this year resurrects the real courtroom drama of the infamous murder trial that shook 90s America. The screenplay will have you on the edge of your seat. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nBlack Mirror : The show is a compilation of six episodes, each narrating a different (horror) story detailing our relationships, and growing reliance on technology. Whether it\u2019s the story of killer robotic bees or a future where your worth is measured in \u2018likes\u2019, Black Mirror will have you looking at your phones very differently. (Netflix)\n\nBetter Call Saul (Season 2) : The show might be only two seasons old, but the spin-off has already outdone its much-celebrated original, Breaking Bad . The series about a small-time lawyer\u2019s path to becoming an ace con-man has excellent story-telling, sharp dialogue, terrific acting, and is one of the best shows on TV right now. (Colors Infinity)\n\nThe Americans (Season 4) : The thriller series about two Russian spies living average American lives during the peak of the Cold War only got better this year. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys give extraordinary performances, yet again, as the show dives deeper into the complex themes of identity, patriotism and family, with a few wigs thrown in.

Like always, such grandeur of envisioning a world vast and beyond always leaves me heavy in the throes of an existential crisis. That or the lack of a 4G network \u2013 both.\n\nIn the midst of all those \u2018why are we here\u2019 and \u2018what does it all matter\u2019 questions, I can\u2019t help but wonder about the pettiness that we occupy ourselves with. How we allow ourselves to fall for beliefs and notions that are nothing but a man-made construct. Religion. Time. Money. And somewhere down the pecking order, the belief that whisky is superior to whiskey.\n\nNow, we understand the purist\u2019s obsession with single malts and the special scoff they reserve for anything that isn\u2019t. One is also not entirely unfamiliar with the new, almost-hipster Bourbon brigade, who put down the Scotch enthusiasts like an endangered species. And let\u2019s not forget the new-age revolutionaries who will back any whisky (or whiskey) as long as it comes from a seemingly obscure country: India. Iceland. Italy. Even France! How about Tasmania down under?\n\nBut we often forget a country that sits on the cusp of all these factions: Irish whiskey. While it is true that most famous Irish distilleries were set up by Scotsmen, let\u2019s not forget that, historically, the art of distilling was brought by Irish monks to the Gaelic Bravehearts in the first place.\n\nThat said, the Irish style of whiskey is unique and very different from any else found around the world. To generalise, Scotch tends to be smoky and toasty, and Bourbon, at the other end of the spectrum, leans towards vanilla and butterscotch, and most other styles (Japanese and such) emulate one of the two with the local weather and master blender providing the nuanced differentiation.\n\nIrish whiskey then, by the same generalisation, is fairly neutral. It is smooth without being toasty, fruity without being ripe. It doesn\u2019t do peat, nor does it do new charred casks. Their idea of whiskey is to make a flavourful easy beverage that does well by itself and also marries well in cocktails. It should appeal to the novice, but also have complexity enough to engage the seasoned tippler. Recently, I was privy to an extended tasting by a popular Irish whiskey brand, Jameson, and these notes are pretty much from my scribbles on that evening.\n\nBut flavour aside, what I really like about them is how they have chosen to reach out to their patrons: no stuffy tastings, no elaborate meal pairings, or men in kilts being paraded through banquets full of thirsty aficionados. Instead, they are looking at more contemporary events and animations to engage people. Even an underground music fest was fair ground for them! Who would have thought that one day we would be enjoying the up-tempo beats of top international DJs with a measure of Jameson and ginger ale?\n\nAnd that is precisely how we should take life: always ready for the unexpected. To enjoy each unanticipated moment without classifying or judging. And as long as the glass has a double pour in it, don\u2019t worry whether it\u2019s whisky or whiskey.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967676.ece/BINARY/31mp_magan.ART_+G39125FDS.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Magandeep Singh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/A-matter-of-E/article16967758.ece", "title": "A matter of E"}, {"text": "Maven Art Academy conducts a two-day Zentangle workshop and a one-day broken glass painting workshop for adults.\n\nThe fee for the workshops is Rs. 950.

Its rolling hills, deep meadows and tall trees will help you leave the noise of the city behind. If you are up for getting out of bed early and going for a trek, head to Dolphin\u2019s Nose. It is a flat rock jutting out of a mountain, shaped like a dolphin\u2019s nose, obviously. Set at an altitude of 6,600ft, Dolphin\u2019s Nose gives you sweeping views of the valley below.

It was taken with a webcam that was slightly bigger than a ping-pong ball, and whose resolution was poorer than the camera of the cheapest phone you get today. But the fact that you could take your own picture at the click of the mouse was mighty exciting, and so, purely in memory of those happy days, I have retained that picture on my blog, even though I barely resemble the man in it.\n\nThereafter, I took countless other selfies with the conventional camera, especially when wife and I would travel: I would put one arm around her and hold the camera with the other, pointing the lens in our direction and \u2014 with some mental calculation \u2014 making sure we were in the frame. Since we couldn\u2019t see ourselves on the display screen, we did not adjust our hair or alter our expressions to look our best: we merely smiled and looked at the lens. Some of our happiest pictures \u2014 whether spontaneously happy or happily spontaneous, I am not sure \u2014 were self-clicked in this fashion.\n\nSo, what the kids are doing today, I have been doing for more than a decade now; only that I did not know back then that such a self-clicked photograph would soon acquire a name, recognised by even the Oxford dictionary: selfie. Needless to say, the venerated dictionary, in keeping with the changing times, defines the \u2018selfie stick\u2019 as well, that too with great clarity: \u2018A device in the form of a rod on which a camera or a smartphone may be mounted, enabling the person holding it to take a photograph of themselves from a wider angle than if holding the camera or smartphone in their hand.\u2019\n\nSelfies are a way of life today. Many of us aren\u2019t even sure whether we live to selfie \u2014 or selfie to live? I have taken the liberty to use selfie as a verb because that\u2019s how it is, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the smartphone-owning society is split into two these days: people who live healthy so that they look naturally good when selfies are taken, and people who feel healthy when their selfies earn widespread admiration on social media.\n\nI don\u2019t know which category I belong to, but I would certainly find it very worrisome if I appeared to be \u2018smart\u2019 and \u2018fit\u2019 \u2014 even if not so in real life \u2014 with the help of the lens. The lens is capable of lying through its teeth, provided you know in which angle to hold the phone: a tubby man, therefore, can look trim \u2014 and once the \u2018likes\u2019 start pouring in, he actually begins to believe that he is in great shape when he isn\u2019t.\n\nWe now live in a world of illusions \u2014 or maya \u2014 something that the sages had always cautioned us against: a protruding tummy looks flat, whereas a perfect pair of feminine lips protrudes. Tonight, when you go partying, no matter where you go, look around: you will find countless pairs of lips protruding as the cameras are turned into the selfie mode \u2014 that is, if you are already not among those who like to pout.\n\nThe practice has become so common that no one any longer bats an eyelid when they find a young woman suddenly stopping in the middle of anywhere and aiming the phone at herself to pout at the screen. As for the woman, during those few moments she spends clicking selfies, she becomes so oblivious to the people around her, as if she were in front of the restroom mirror.\n\nBut: why pout when clicking a selfie? That, to me, shall remain the unanswered question from 2016, even as I wish you a Happy 2017.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967691.ece/BINARY/31mpBG.ART_GRA1+GPH12ACT1.2.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Bishwanath Ghosh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Happy-2017-But-why-do-you-pout/article16967734.ece", "title": "Happy 2017! But why do you pout?"}, {"text": "New Year\u2019s Eve brings with it the inevitable and rather unavoidable question: \u201cWhat are your resolutions going to be?\u201d With the New Year being symbolic of new opportunities, new adventures and new choices, we have to agree this question makes us ponder over the past year\u2019s events.\n\nHowever, house and home resolutions always tend to get sidelined. What are those small changes that would make our home a touch cosier and more streamlined? I\u2019ve noted down three key resolutions. Let\u2019s call them \u201cspacelutions\u201d for the fun of it, shall we? And the best part about house and home resolutions is you don\u2019t have to stop eating chocolate to achieve any of them!\n\nDeclutter\n\nStart by assessing all that you currently own and that\u2019s on display. Be it vases, photo frames, knick knack bowls, candles, and more. Once you take stock of it all, it becomes easier to cull what you truly want to keep. I love to pepper my living room with photos, but I do always make a mental note to keep it in check, so it doesn\u2019t make the space overwhelming. Similarly, maybe you don\u2019t need to display all your showpieces at once. Choose your current favourite and make that your star piece.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your key d\u00e9cor elements in place, vow to clean up those drawers that hold forgotten notes, old bills, bookmarks, medicines and more. Make catch-all baskets and trinket trays your best friend. Streamlining spaces that are visible is easy enough. But only once those little nooks and crannies are spruced up too do you feel like you can tick this resolution off your new year to-do list.\n\nStay get-together ready, always\n\nAt the turn of the new year, each of us vow to put in effort into spending quality time with our loved ones. So why not lend your home space that inviting feel? Starting in the new year, vow to make every living space get-together and guest-friendly. Small and simple changes help you achieve this in the most seamless of ways. Make sure that vase in your living room always has a bunch of fresh flowers. Take stock of old magazines that tend to pile up in the bathroom or bedroom and stow them away to give to the old paper mart. This helps in keeping your home clutter-free ever so often. Ensure you always have a clean set of bed and bath linen ready in the guest bedroom in case a relative pops by for a short stay. I also always fluff and switch up my couch and floor cushions so that they\u2019re always a tad lived-in and not entirely stiff for when guests pop over.\n\nKeep your d\u00e9cor elements seasonal\n\nIf you keep flowers at your foyer, apart from the year-round rotation of roses, orchids, and lilies, switch up and opt for flowers that are seasonal. Similarly for scented candles \u2013 in the summers, opt for tropical and sunny scents; maybe even choose tropical-inspired pieces to go with. Pick rain forest-esque scents for the monsoon and pine and cinnamon for the winters for that cosy, toasty feel. Doing this helps in bringing in and reflecting the current season indoors too.\n\nThe simplest things make the most impact.

I firmly believe that if you are an optimist or an enthusiast, you will be disappointed more. I am neither of those. When I take the Metro in the morning, if I get a seat, I am happy !\u201d\n\nBut for Maheep, who regards Charlie Chaplin and Johnny Walker as his favourite comedians, 2016 also gave him ample material for his performance. \u201cAs a comedian, I have to thank all the politicians for continuing to give us such good material.\u201d\n\nThe talk turned towards demonetisation, and how a comedian handles it. \u201cThe regular citizen in me agrees with it. But the comedian in me is enjoying it a lot. So earlier, I never used to go to the ATM much. But now, since it is not so available, and the human tendency is to go after things which we can\u2019t easily get, I stand in queues at the ATM. There is always enough material I can get from there for my shows. For example, if you don\u2019t choose English on the ATM machine, the person behind you will judge you. I have seen blue collar workers, who have never spoken a word of English, choosing English in the ATM machine.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cI don\u2019t have much money, because let\u2019s face it, I am a comedian.

Not having gone to any of these places, the question on everyone\u2019s mind was \u201cso what else is there to see in China?\u201d Well, it was a whole different world out there, from giant pandas to UNESCO World Heritage Sites like the Jiuzhaigou National Park, which is a 72,000-hectare biosphere reserve, and Huanglong, which is the world-famous travertine landscape to the highest railway line in the world.\n\nThe best experience for me was travelling on the Qinghai Railway (Qinghai, pronounced as Chinghai, is a high-altitude Tibetan plateau). This railway line was built to connect the Tibetan city of Lhasa to China\u2019s vast rail network. The journey of 1,956 km is covered in 21 hours. Though spread across various elevations, the Tanggula railway station, at an elevation of 5,068 m (16,627 feet), makes it the highest railway station in the world. We crossed 675 bridges through 10 tunnels and 44 stations before reaching our destination at Xining. Another significant fact about the line is that 550 km of it is laid on permafrost (rock or soil that\u2019s solid icy during winter but mushy in summer).\n\nWe boarded the train in Lhasa, Tibet, where the train arrived 45 minutes prior to departure. As I entered the carriage, it seemed like just another first-class Indian train compartment. The corridor of the compartment is lined with foldable seats to let travellers get a better view from the windows. Small oxygen vents are placed at every few feet on the corridor to maintain the level of oxygen inside the train that\u2019s moving at such a high elevation. The air at these altitudes is much thinner, with the oxygen level being 40 to 50 per cent lower than that at sea level. Just visiting the plateau can make people pass out; hard physical activity at these heights can even prove fatal. We learnt that a major part of the construction from Lhasa to Golmud (1,142 km) was completed in five years.\n\nAs the train passed along the plateau, I was thrilled to see the beauty outside while sitting in the comfort of my warm cabin. We spotted a number of yaks grazing on what looked like snow-covered grass, the rare Tibetan antelope, a few wild asses and many snow-capped mountains. We passed by the beautiful and magnificent Cona Lake, which is sprawled over 409 square metres. Such flat sites at a height averaging 4,500 meters explained why the Tibetan plateau is often referred to as the \u2018Roof of the world\u2019. The only disappointment during the trip was not being able to catch a glimpse of the Tanggula railway station (the highest station in the word). The train does not stop at this station. We were eagerly waiting to take snaps of the station when the train passed by it, but unfortunately, found a goods train blocking our view. All the passengers sighed in disappointment.\n\nSome pointers for those who intend to try this 21-hour experience:\n\nlPack light. There isn\u2019t much space to accommodate big suitcases in the compact coupe.\n\nlCarry binoculars and a good camera with telephoto lens.\n\nlIf you\u2019re a vegetarian, carry instant noodles or ready-to-eat Indian food, as hot water is available on the train.\n\nlCarry sachets of coffee, tea and milk powder, as only yak milk is available. You can try yak yoghurt that tastes almost similar to cow\u2019s milk yoghurt, except it is much sweeter.\n\nlAvoid buying oxygen cans or oxygenated water, as there are plenty of oxygen outlets on the train, even in the coupes. Each couple gets four oxygen outlets; oxygen tubes are available on request.\n\nThe oxygen level at these altitudes is 40 to 50 per cent lower than it is at sea level", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967765.ece/BINARY/31mp_train_trav+GMA12BRHA.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Pooja Bhatt"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Somewhere-over-the-rail-line/article16967768.ece", "title": "Somewhere over the rail line"}, {"text": "\u201cWhat are you doing on New Year\u2019s Eve?\u201d Admit it, there\u2019s too much pressure when that question is asked. Especially when it\u2019s almost D-Day and you still haven\u2019t a clue. While it\u2019s perfectly all right to stay home and watch TV or go out for a quiet meal, there are those for whom ringing in the new year is all about loud music, partying and dancing the night away. For them, the options are plenty. But now, with everything being about trying out new adventures, there are quite a few who want a more exclusive experience. For them, we list the five most luxurious ways of celebrating the new year in Chennai.\n\nTurn to page 8\n\nFrom page 1\n\nFitfor a king\n\nHow about booking the most expensive room in the city? Sounds great, but here\u2019s a word of advice: You may need to save up for it. For example, the presidential suite at The Leela Palace, one of the most expensive rooms in the city, is all yours for Rs. 2,50,000 for a night.\n\nYes, we don\u2019t blame you if you thought it was the rate for a month.\n\nAnd along with that hefty price tag come opulence and luxury. The room measures 4,842 sq. ft., and includes a master bedroom, a washroom with Jacuzzi, a second bedroom, a living room where you can entertain your guests with perhaps a bottle of Moet & Chandon from one of the three mini bars, before the party moves to the personal dining area for 10.\n\nAnd if you feel too stuffed after the party, feel free to use your private gym or pop over to your personal spa to get rid of those wine cramps.\n\nSilver chairs, mother of pearl coating, silk robes and the scent of exotic flowers add to the luxe experience.\n\nSail to a new beginning\n\nSan Francisco, Dubai, Maldives... they\u2019re all big on yacht parties. Some yachts are big enough to have vintage-themed balls and masquerade dances. Sounds intriguing? There\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t try it out as well. Chennai\u2019s blue sea has more than just catamarans and speed boats bobbing about.\n\nQuite a few companies rent out yachts for get-togethers or a quiet rendezvous. Usher in your new year glamorously, lounging on one of these yachts in the Bay of Bengal, with the silver moon and crashing waves for company, and a bottle of bubbly. Abhishek Roy, who runs Blue Mile, says he\u2019s already received bookings for New Year\u2019s Eve and the first of January. Shortly, he plans to start renting out his yacht for overnight stays as well. Prices vary and usually begin at about Rs. 10,000.\n\nPamper your senses\n\nThe perfect way to welcome the new year is by treating yourself to a relaxing day at the spa. And while you\u2019re at it, might as well make it a royal experience. Why not try the Royal Bliss Package (priced at Rs. 10,000 plus taxes) at Kaya Kalp at ITC Grand Chola then? One of the most expensive spa treatments in town, the 150-minute session promises to leave you feeling rejuvenated. With an ayurvedic exfoliation, a Kaya Kalp massage and a deep cleaning facial, this spa treatment is for hotel guests and members only.\n\nThe guest is welcomed with a special drink made with ginger, lemon and basil leaf, before the signature treatment begins with a luxury foot ritual with rose petals, a sea salt scrub and an ayurvedic red sandal scrub to squeeze out dead skin. This is followed by the Kaya Kalp massage and a deep cleaning facial. And by the time you\u2019re done being pampered, there\u2019s some refreshment and herbal tea to look forward to.\n\nNow that\u2019s a day well spent.\n\nRoyal repast\n\nWhy must your celebrations end with New Year\u2019s Eve? Let the party continue on January 1 as well, as you take your loved one for a romantic dinner overlooking the Bay of Bengal at Vivanta by Taj \u2013 Fisherman\u2019s Cove. Called Watch Tower Dining, the meal can be arranged only upon prior reservation. According to the hotel, the Watch Tower redefines intimacy with a captivating experience on the white sands. The experience begins the moment the guest arrives at the hotel, and is met by a charming cart to be driven to the venue. A personal butler receives you with a welcome drink and shell garlands, before helping you get comfortable in the machan overlooking the bay. What follows is an exclusive four-course meal, customised for you by the chef. It\u2019s the perfect way to get away from the maddening crowds and revel in your very own private nook. The Watch Tower dinner is priced at Rs. 30,000 plus taxes, excluding beverages.\n\nArrive in style\n\nIf you\u2019ve got luxury on your mind this New Year\u2019s, how can your ride be any less? But that certainly doesn\u2019t mean you have to burn a hole in your pocket trying to buy a fancy set of wheels. With luxury car rental services like Luxury8 and Eco Rent A Car, your options are pretty varied. According to P.N. Ranbir, manager sales at Luxury8, one of the most expensive cars in their stable is the Jaguar XJL. \u201cIt\u2019s the top-end model and is priced at Rs. 1 crore 80 lakh.\u201d But you can zip around town on this set of wheels for about Rs. 25,000 for eight hours or 80 kilometres, and with a chauffeur to boot. The car has already been booked for New Year\u2019s, according to Ranbir. And if you\u2019re looking to rent it for outstation travel, Ranbir says it can be arranged at a price of Rs. 250 per km.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967717.ece/BINARY/31-mp-Chandrale+G5812EM0B.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Ranjani Rajendra", "Priyadarshini Paitandy"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Ring-in-the-new/article16967718.ece1", "title": "Ring in the new"}]], ["Coimbatore", [{"text": "\u2019Tis the season for not just joy but for horror too. But wait, there are some laughs as well.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Mo , the Tamil film that hits screens this week. Directed by debutant Bhuvan Nullan, this film falls under the horror-comedy genre, one that has proved to be successful for Kollywood for a while now.\n\nThe teaser of the film, which released in November, established the genre. It opens with Nagesh and Balaiah in that epic \u2018horror film\u2019 scene in the 1964 flick Kadhalikka Neramillai and intersperses that interestingly with scenes from Mo .\n\n\u201cThat was the plan for the teaser from the time I started work on this project,\u201d smiles Bhuvan, a mechanical engineering graduate, who was smitten by filmmaking, \u201cThat scene is epic for anyone who has followed Tamil cinema. Every horror filmmaker relates to that. I knew that juxtaposing that with my scenes will work in favour of my film.\u201d\n\nApart from popular actors, like Aishwarya Rajesh, Suresh Ravi, Yogi Babu, Mime Gopi and Darbuka Siva, that he\u2019s roped in, Bhuvan believes that the content itself would attract audiences. \u201cI know that there have been many horror-comedies in the recent past, but I firmly believe that Mo will stand out,\u201d says Bhuvan, who had earlier assisted Selva of Naan Avan Illai fame and directed a few short films before bagging his first feature.\n\nThat conviction stems from the fact that the \u2018pei\u2019 factor in the film is more fun than fear. \u201cIn every horror film, the ghost usually has a back story \u2014 about how it came into being \u2014 and why it takes revenge on someone. Here, the reason is quite silly\u2026 but a lot of fun,\u201d he says, giving us a sneak peek into the film\u2019s story.\n\nThe team parked itself in a school in Sriperumbudur for a couple of weeks (\u201cthat\u2019s where 60 per cent of the shoot got done\u201d) and wrapped up the entire film in a month.\n\n\u201cThe location plays a vital factor in a script like this,\u201d explains the filmmaker.\n\nS.R.\n\n\u2018Was scared during shoot\u2019\n\nShe plays a ghost herself in the film, but Aishwarya Rajesh was actually scared out of her wits during the shoot of Mo . \u201cThe general perception is that while watching horror films is scary, shooting for them is fun. However, that wasn\u2019t exactly the case with this film. We shot in a school that has been shut for many years now, and we mostly shot at night. So, despite donning the role of a ghost, I was quite scared when I heard weird sounds,\u201d says the actor, who is a big fan of English films like The Conjuring and Lights Out .\n\nThe location plays a vital role in a horror film \u2014 we shot extensively in a school in Sriperumbudur\n\nBhuvan Nullan", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16957522.ece/BINARY/Copy_of_29MP_mo+GPV125A31.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["S R"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/The-funny-ghost/article16967770.ece", "title": "The funny ghost"}, {"text": "Hello fellow-earthlings, we did it! We went around the sun one more time. What I don\u2019t understand is, why are we celebrating it as if it is some sort of an achievement by us humans. Clearly, we didn\u2019t have a choice no? Gravity held us here and so we stayed. Otherwise, Chennai folks would have drifted off to another planet and put their kids into a \u2018strict\u2019 engineering college in Jupiter or some such. That would\u2019ve been a real achievement.\n\nBut I digress. I wanted to talk about celebrating New Year\u2019s. Or more specifically, about New Year\u2019s Eve parties. Now, if you were raised in Chennai, there is only one way of celebrating New Year\u2019s. You don\u2019t. Boss, who in their right mind spends money to usher in the New Year yaar! I understand that we have all been told people are supposed to do \u2018cool\u2019 things. Like sliding chest-down along a table like Kamal Haasan, screaming \u2018Hi everybodyyy\u2019 in S.P. Balasubrahmanyam\u2019s voice, but you only ended up crashing on your younger sibling sitting on the other side of the table, thereby earning a thunderous thud on your back by one of your parents. Not the ideal way to welcome a New Year.\n\nOr trying to be like the \u2018cool\u2019 kids in the movie Anjali , who wear sneakers inside the house, sneak out of their apartments in the middle of the night and go around the city singing songs with strangers. Boss, which Chennai kid could go out and do such a thing I just cannot imagine! I tried doing that once (it was not even New Year\u2019s Eve and it was not even midnight) and yet I was caught in the act before even moving out of the bed, for I was sleeping next to my grandmother, who slept with her eyes open. In the days before technology, my grandmother was a CCTV camera, GPS monitoring system and voice-based alarm mechanism all rolled into one.\n\nSo on December 31, at best, our apartment residents association would put up a \u2018variety show\u2019 and distribute potato chips and Rasna. So much for \u2018partying\u2019. A few years later, while in college, there were rumours about how my friend\u2019s friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s neighbours were part of this \u2018awesome\u2019 New Year party, and how they all counted down and rang in the New Year in great style. Interestingly, no one you knew directly ever went to these parties. There was also this \u2018cool gang\u2019 that boasted of having gone to Goa to party all the way through New Year\u2019s Eve. There were also terms such as \u2018farm house parties\u2019, \u2018beach house parties\u2019 thrown at us poor kids, who didn\u2019t even understand what they meant. It was all a grand mystery, and yet I badly wanted to be a part of it.\n\nWhile all my parents wanted was a simple university rank and a gold medal out of me, all I wanted was to get invited to at least one New Year party. It was around this age when the newspapers were also full of advertisements with captions such as \u2018New Year Bash\u2019 or \u2018New Year Gala\u2019. Entry for such parties was priced slightly less than the going rate for a kidney or a liver, which unfortunately were already pledged for my engineering education. It became my life\u2019s goal to attend at least one New Year party.\n\nNow, many years later, even though I earn enough to afford an occasional litre of petrol, the mysterious New Year party continues to elude me. A few days back, I came across another ad that said \u2018New Year\u2019s eve midnight dinner buffet\u2019 and my first thought was, \u2018Who in their right mind eats dinner buffet at midnight?\u2019 A few seconds later, my second thought was \u2018OK, I have to go to this buffet now\u2019. I decided to splurge and called up the fine-dining restaurant to reserve a table for two. The manager promised me a table at 10 p.m. sharp on December 31, 2018. I laughingly appreciated his sense of humour, to which he replied, with the seriousness of a cardiac-surgeon, that their restaurant was booked for the next two years.\n\nWhat?! Who are these strange human beings who reserve dinner tables two years in advance? I politely cancelled my reservation and decided to try other places for mediocre mass-cooked food and diluted drinks at hyper-inflated prices. I received a similar response everywhere. People had already signed up to spend unnecessary amounts of money, thereby denying me the chance to do the same.\n\nSo, I am waiting as the earth begins one more revolution around the sun. Hopefully, next year, I will be invited to a \u2018New Year Gala Bash.\u2019 And while we wait for another 365 days, here\u2019s wishing everyone a great laughter-filled 2017.\n\nThe Local Tea Party is a popular blogger from Chennai, known for his quirky prose.

And what\u2019s the fun of it without much ado? So, while midnight is still distant, let\u2019s run a quick check on what we need to do for a fun party.\n\nKeep it colourful : More often than not, everyone wants a break from the routine on the first day of the year. No one likes the idea of a heap of dishes waiting to be done, so go disposable and opt for colourful pint glasses, shot tubes, shooters and even Martini glasses.\n\nWhile at it, look for a dip platter and dinner plates that are unbreakable. Want to look fantastically upbeat with the d\u00e9cor? Then go for the glow glasses.\n\nDress right : House parties are the coolest because one need not worry much the dress code.\n\nJust be dressed for the occasion. Keep it fun, keep it whacky. Get the Afro wigs; they may not be new but they are still going strong on the trendsetting charts. The coloured Afros are the most popular, but plain ones also add to a new look.\n\nHair bands : You can be Minnie Mouse, Rudolph, an angel or a stylish devil. LED-lit hair bands are the easiest party gear to grab to make a style statement.\n\nThe battery-operated LED light glows and makes a pretty picture in the dark. With the boomerang app you sure can earn a few hundred likes with these. Bunny ears are also never out of fashion to look silly and fun.\n\nGlow jewellery: Want to look like a glow worm? Forget make-up and make-up glitter.\n\nInstead, opt for glow jewellery like ear rings, rings and necklaces. You are sure to make heads turn with them.\n\nLED frames: Wear the hearts that glow or frames that have LED straws through the frame. The streaming light makes a party fashion statement without disturbing the view. Some frames also come with faces of cartoon characters, but they are probably best suited for a Halloween party.\n\nLED straws : Keep them scattered around the place of party.\n\nThe coloured sticks will glow and add decent light around the area without having to think of altering the lights around the house. When the night is meant to be danced away, no one wants to be under bright lights.\n\nWhistle it in: Finally when the clock strikes 12, no one complains of the noise. So go ahead, keep the horns and whistles ready and ring in 2017 with a bang.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967782.ece/BINARY/hy31party-gear.+G6L11NSB4.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Prabalika M"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Go-ahead-have-a-blast/article16967787.ece", "title": "Go ahead, have a blast"}, {"text": "If you haven\u2019t hopped on to the velvet train yet, tonight\u2019s your chance. Those flirty ruffles in shirts and balloon sleeves aren\u2019t the only outcome of the global Victorian fashion obsession we\u2019ve been experiencing all season. Fashion critics say the luxe fabric will star at all New Year\u2019s Eve parties that matter, on both men and women. \u201cThis time of the year, expect OTT. Look for voluminous sleeves, \u201880s details and a lot of bling. Fortunately, the makeup is toned down, with just a strong mouth or brow. And the hair stays natural with a messy pulled-back look,\u201d begins Krishna Mukhi, stylist and former Fashion Features Director atHarper\u2019s Bazaar India.\n\nHere\u2019s breaking down the dress code for the night ahead:\n\nVelvet reloaded: Metal and velvet \u2014 you could do either one or both. High-octane glamour from Balmain, Gucci and Givenchy make the cut this season, but if you are partial to Indian designers, Huemn, the inventive Rajesh Pratap Singh and Atsu are the labels to hunt down. \u201cHuemn did \u201880s nostalgia very well at fashion weeks this year, with distinctive fur accents,\u201d continues Krishna. At the online fashion address, Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop, the label\u2019s black-and-gold cutdana embroidered gown, at Rs. 65,500, is a keeper. Meanwhile, the store\u2019s founder, Pernia Qureshi, also votes for Atsu\u2019s panelled, lace-up and one-shoulder wrap dresses in black. \u201cAtsu\u2019s clothes are feminine and chic and they fit like a glove. Both he and Shivan & Narresh did their best collection at Lakme this year,\u201d she insists. Her website has had many takers for Shivan & Narresh\u2019s palazzos with gold skein work.\n\nBerry fantastic: Blackest blackcurrant it is. Deep, dark and dramatic hues were undeniably the biggest trend for lips this season, and Krishna references the berry-like mouths on show at Rodarte, Marni and Erdem. \u201cMany of our Indian designers did it too, but the most striking of all were the lacquered black-cherry pouts at Louis Vuitton and Dior, the latter created with Dior\u2019s Rouge Dior in Poison coated with Dior Addict Ultra Gloss for a mirror finish. My personal favourite, though, is MAC\u2019s Cyber,\u201d she adds.\n\nFor the eyes, glitter and metallic updates are inevitable in the corner of the eye or near the cheekbones, but we\u2019re betting on the berry eye (wine shades) seen on Emanuel Ungaro\u2019s models at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year.\n\nBoots on board: You can\u2019t take thigh-high boots and slits out of the party circuit, but chunky platforms and strappy feminine sandals are definitely in. \u201cIf you plan to go partying in flats, they must have an element of glamour, with jewelled or faux leather detail. There is baroque too, toned down,\u201d says Krishna, pulling out images of velvet loafers from Miu Miu.\n\nInstant shine : For pocket-friendly last-minute purchases, like Bansri\u2019s body harness or Outhouse\u2019s chokers, try Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop and multi-designer stores like Amethyst and Evoluzione.\n\nMen\u2019s style\n\nJacket check : \u201cCarry the right attitude. This is the best accessory any man can ever possess!\u201d is sartorial savant Rohit Bal\u2019s blunt advice to our party-ready man. Some cajoling later, \u201cIt depends on what kind of party it is.

For the first time in recent memory, the number of memorable new shows this year far outstripped the number of new films released.\n\nSome fear this embarrassment of riches on television cannot be sustained. A recent study by FX, an American cable channel, revealed that the number of shows in the US increased by 94 per cent from 2009 to 2015. This growth is now being driven largely by streaming services such as Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video, all of which have invested heavily in producing original content. According to Janney, a financial services firm, Netflix set aside $5 billion for producing original content in 2016.\n\nIndian viewers, of course, could barely be less pleased \u2014 after all, both Netflix and Amazon Video arrived this year. Even as we rejoice and look forward to more in 2017, here is a look at some of the shows that captivated us in 2016:\n\nPlanet Earth II\n\nIt is hard to believe David Attenborough is 90. His distinct voice \u2014 with its signature crackle \u2014 permeates the second coming of BBC\u2019s Planet Earth . It has been ten years since the last edition enthralled viewers. Much has changed in the world since then, Attenborough informs us. It is much more fragile; much more in need of appreciation and conservation. Planet Earth II goes beyond the previous show \u2014 which itself had gone far beyond anything that came before it \u2014 in order to show us the magnificence of the natural world. (It was filmed in three years by a camera crew of 22 in 40 countries.) Across six episodes, steered by Attenborough\u2019s authoritative narration, Planet Earth II transcends the medium and shows us a planet of immense richness, and a heart-breakingly uncertain future. Frequently, we are chastened by the realisation that, in the struggle for survival, our planet can be unforgivingly cruel too.\n\nFleabag\n\nThe best television drama of the year is also the shortest. At about 162 minutes, which really is feature-film length, Fleabag is eminently viewable in a single dash. Phoebe Waller-Bridge must certainly be the find of the year. She directs, writes (the show is an adaption of her own play), and also acts as the eponymous Fleabag \u2014 an obnoxious, conflicted misfit who struggles to find her feet in London after a personal tragedy. Deceptively simple, yet layered, Fleabag offers a wealth of vantage points. At the level of comedy, the gags are fresh, occasionally uncomfortable, and mostly dark in their humour. The digs come fast and furious \u2014 at straitjacketed family life; at familial relationships; at men who consider women beneath them; at women who accept infidelity, and find themselves paralysed by inaction. The most devastating indictment remains for Fleabag, who must make peace with her own horridness.\n\nFull Frontal with Samantha Bee\n\nFull Frontal with Samantha Bee is unique for being a news comedy show hosted by a woman. Right at the beginning of the first episode, Bee fields questions from men: \u201cIs it hard breaking into the boys\u2019 club? What does it feel like being a woman on a late night show?\u201d These questions in themselves answer what a break from tradition this show is\u2014and, indeed, how important.\n\nSamantha Bee was the longest-tenured correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. She brings her mighty experience to her own show, but wears it with lightness. The witty one-liners fly off her sleeve; more devastating are the moments of exposition taken entirely from real news footage. Unlike other late night shows, Bee takes a hard look at women\u2019s issues consistently \u2014 from abortion laws, to the long-suffering wives of politicians, to Kansas\u2019s dress code for women in the Senate (\u201cyour state\u2019s got 99 problems, but a bitch ain\u2019t one\u201d). Along with Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Krysten Ritter (Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones), Samantha Bee makes up the triumvirate of excellence in television. If recent shows are any indication, gone are the days, hopefully, of women playing second fiddle, or, at best, one of an ensemble. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , which shares the studio with the show, at last has a worthy, and necessary, compatriot.\n\nAtlanta\n\nIt\u2019s likely that half-way into the first episode of Atlanta , viewers might \u2014 with some guilt \u2014 note that it\u2019s very hard to spot a single white character in the show. By the end of the first season, that feeling becomes a distant memory, and one revels in the feeling of having watched something quite original and edifying. Atlanta is a perceptive look at the struggles of two African-American rappers to make it in America. It wears its identity lightly but never turns away from issues that matter \u2014police brutality, internet trolling, mental illness and the never-ending quest for love.\n\nHere\u2019s an exercise: try thinking of the most popular shows of the last 20 years. Chosen at random, one would arrive at perhaps the following: Seinfeld, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, The West Wing, How I Met Your Mother . Atlanta holds its own against the best, and is another nail in the coffin for TV shows run by white men. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s written and directed by Donald Glover, who plays one of the two leads. Watch out for him in next year\u2019s Spiderman: Homecoming , and the under-production Han Solo Star Wars film.\n\nThe Night Manager\n\nTom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie star in a six-episode cat-and-mouse thriller\u2014an adaptation of John le Carre\u2019s 1993 novel of the same name. Fans of Hiddleston and Laurie (who isn\u2019t?) barely need to be persuaded to watch the show. For those who aren\u2019t, it\u2019s a showcase for both men\u2019s considerable acting talents and should win them new admirers. The basic plot is trite (seeking revenge for the death of a loved one by infiltrating an arms dealer\u2019s inner circle) and has seen multiple iterations over the years. But sharp, edge-of-the-seat writing, gorgeous camera-work, and the two leading men elevate the source material.\n\nHiddleston, as the hurt lover, broods quietly, biding his time to pounce upon Laurie, the egregious arms dealer. Laurie, for his part, ensconced in his outrageously beautiful villa (or is it a fortress?) in Spain, perfects a swagger that accompanies a steel-cold heart. One of the stars of the show (to the delight of Fleabag fans) is Olivia Colman, who plays a pregnant intelligence officer. Perfectly cast as the obnoxious stepmother in Fleabag , she offers a strong case for being cast in more shows.\n\nAlso Watch Stranger Things, The Crown, Westworld, Marvel\u2019s Jessica Jones, The Night Of.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967703.ece/BINARY/31bgmTVstory_GG+GHE12F0VG.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Shubhodeep Pal"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Idiot-box-no-more/article16967792.ece", "title": "Idiot box no more"}, {"text": "\u201cDon\u2019t let that cat in here.\u201d My normally placid mother-in-law was very vehement.\n\n\u201cBut, ma,\u201d I argued, \u201ccats are like that. You can\u2019t blame her for being what she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s evil,\u201d was the implacable response.\n\nThis was an ongoing argument every time we spotted The Silly Cat, as we called her. At first, amma hadn\u2019t been so vociferous in her condemnation of the brindled feline. The cat wandered in and out of the house and the school grounds. One morning, we discovered that her sleeping quarters were the top of amma\u2019s cupboard. We\u2019d been sitting on the bed, idly chatting, when a head rose above the boxes stacked on the cupboard. A baleful glare fixed us and The Silly Cat rose and stretched luxuriously before making her way out. When it was tea time, she would beg for biscuits or potato chips. If we didn\u2019t give them to her, she\u2019d just climb up to wherever we\u2019d stored them and help herself. Then came the day when amma discovered The Silly Cat under her bed, chewing on the remains of a kitten. I insisted that the kitten had probably died and the cat was just disposing off the carcass. There was just an eloquent shudder in reply.\n\nAmma definitely preferred the dogs. Jimmy, the mongrel, had walked into the premises, as a three or four year old, 10 years ago and never left. No animal can enter without Jimmy giving us warning. But he didn\u2019t think humans were worth bothering about. So, we occasionally found assorted drunks, who tried to use the school as a thoroughfare into the village, wandering around the campus.\n\nJimmy\u2019s pet aversion was being subjected to the indignity of a bath. He believed that bathing was only for sissy dogs. In the early days, before he knew better, he was caught and cleaned forcibly. It was a trying time for both Jimmy and the bather. Soon better sense prevailed. People left Jimmy alone, except when it was time for vaccination.\n\nA few years later came three-year-old Lyca. An abandoned golden Labrador, she found herself a home by the simple expedient of jumping into amma\u2019s car as if she had every right to be there when amma visited an animal shelter. My mother-in-law didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her she didn\u2019t belong. So she did the next best thing; she brought Lyca home. Jimmy was cautious at first but soon learnt that Lyca was no bark and no bite.\n\nAs the skinny frame filled out, Lyca was the perfect example of how beautiful her breed could be. But the filling out process didn\u2019t stop and Lyca now resembles a beached whale. Every now and then, especially when the vet threatens us with dire consequences, we try to put Lyca on a diet. It\u2019s hard because none of us is really good at dieting. Lyca is also a past master at finding herself something to eat. If she\u2019s not inveigling the crows to drop her something that we\u2019d rather she not eat, she\u2019s coaxing our neighbour into sharing his food with her.\n\nThe third dog, a dachshund cross, is smaller than either Jimmy or Lyca. Even as a pup, the little fellow had loads of attitude. He would walk around with his head up, as if trying to reach Lyca\u2019s or Jimmy\u2019s height, unafraid of anything or anyone. When he first came, amma and I named him Chocolate. What we didn\u2019t take into account was the Kabali fever raging at that time. The non-teaching staff, who were very amused by his antics and with whom he spent much of the day, began referring to him as Kabali. So he was Kabali during the day and Chocolate in the evenings. That strut alone should have warned us. Soon he wouldn\u2019t even look up at our cries of \u2018Chocolate\u2019. Why would he answer to a namby-pamby Chocolate when he had a more macho name in Kabali? Amma and I struggled for a bit but eventually gave up.\n\nIt was Kabali who helped us with Lean Lyca campaign. He wanted to play and he didn\u2019t see why his two canine friends couldn\u2019t join him. Jimmy, now at least 13 years old, only wants to warm his ancient bones in the sun and not have to mentor a cocky young pup. Lyca just wanted to digest her last meal, which had probably been eaten five minutes ago. Kabali would dash in, ears and tail flying, and fling himself on Jimmy or Lyca. Jimmy would allow the pup to worry his stomach or throat for a bit and then warn him off. Lyca would try to run away, or rather waddle away, with Kabali hanging on to her tail or her ears. Lyca certainly lost some weight thanks to play time.\n\nNow that Kabali is in the process of growing up, we are thinking of looking for a pup who will fill the gap when Jimmy eventually decides he\u2019s had enough of this life.\n\nWhy would he answer to a namby-pamby Chocolate when he had a more macho name in Kabali?", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967775.ece/BINARY/31cbmp-anaikatt+G1G121M9I.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["R Krithika"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/The-silly-cat-and-other-stories/article16967777.ece", "title": "The silly cat and other stories"}, {"text": "An avalanche of new content stormed our television screens in 2016. But some shows stood taller than the rest.\n\nHere are the 10 best shows of 2016, in no particular order.\n\nThe Crown : The Crown traces the life of a young Queen Elizabeth II, as she struggles to balance the monumental responsibility that has been thrust on her, with her once \u2018regular\u2019 life. Claire Foy is stunning as a young woman with an immense burden on her shoulders. The show is visually arresting, tightly-scripted and is proof that story-telling is, and always will be, superior to big-budget special effects. (Netflix)\n\nWestworld : What happens when robots created for human pleasure discover consciousness? Worse, what happens when they realise the magnitude of the abuse they\u2019ve been put through? A mind-bending storyline with equally confounding twists and a cast that reads like an honour roll, no show this year is capable of making you stay up at night the way Westworld does. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nStranger Things : The Eighties are back with this eerie sci-fi mystery that plays like a Stephen King novel. Stranger Things boasts of not only Winona Ryder (who is flawless as a distraught mother trying to make sense of aliens in her backyard), but also the most lovable 10-year-olds in recent television history. (Netflix)\n\nThe Night Of: Dark and gripping, The Night Of is, to borrow from the show, a subtle beast. Naz Khan finds himself accused of a gory murder, and it doesn\u2019t help that he has no recollection of events. Riz Ahmed, John Turturro and Bill Camp are fantastic in this courtroom drama that makes no mince of discussing racial prejudice and Islamophobia in the backdrop of the American justice system. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nThe Night Manager : John le Carre\u2019s riveting espionage novel is brought to life by this lavish BBC production, which has some sublime acting performances. Hugh Laurie transforms into Richard \u2018The Worst Man In The World\u2019 Roper, a billionaire weapons dealer, and Olivia Colman is brilliant as Angela Burr, the determined British enforcement agent who\u2019s out to catch him. As for Tom Hiddleston, the show may as well be one which cements his place as the next James Bond.\n\nGame of Thrones (Season 6) : The sixth season of Game of Thrones premi\u00e8red this year, with each episode having a bigger revelation than the next. With resurrections, family reunions and sweet revenge, the season was probably the fastest moving in terms of storyline after the first, and the final episodeswere masterpieces. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story : This miniseries that swept the Emmys this year resurrects the real courtroom drama of the infamous murder trial that shook 90s America. The screenplay will have you on the edge of your seat. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nBlack Mirror : The show is a compilation of six episodes, each narrating a different (horror) story detailing our relationships, and growing reliance on technology. Whether it\u2019s the story of killer robotic bees or a future where your worth is measured in \u2018likes\u2019, Black Mirror will have you looking at your phones very differently. (Netflix)\n\nBetter Call Saul (Season 2) : The show might be only two seasons old, but the spin-off has already outdone its much-celebrated original, Breaking Bad . The series about a small-time lawyer\u2019s path to becoming an ace con-man has excellent story-telling, sharp dialogue, terrific acting, and is one of the best shows on TV right now. (Colors Infinity)\n\nThe Americans (Season 4) : The thriller series about two Russian spies living average American lives during the peak of the Cold War only got better this year. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys give extraordinary performances, yet again, as the show dives deeper into the complex themes of identity, patriotism and family, with a few wigs thrown in.

Excerpts\n\nHave you always been so outspoken?\n\nAre you referring to my conversation two minutes ago or to my comments on Twitter?\n\nOn Twitter\n\nTwitter for me is fun. I don\u2019t take it too seriously. I like to make people happy. Most often I am the butt of the joke. I don\u2019t make fun of people. I try not to hurt anyone. I don\u2019t resent anyone. If, however, I have hurt anyone, I apologise, I say I am sorry. I have become sceptical about voicing my opinions now and only come out if I see injustice like in the case of my niece\u2019s child.\n\nDon\u2019t they say being outspoken and non-diplomatic in Bollywood is like committing hara-kiri?\n\nNo, this is who I am. Standards are set all the time of what is acceptable and what is not.\n\nDid you always want to become an actor?\n\nAs far as I can remember. I come from a family of actors. We are steeped in it. I am thankful to god that I have been able to carry the legacy forward.\n\nAre you a method actor?\n\nNot at all! I am a spontaneous actor, an instant coffee, instant noodle kind of actor. I respect all schools of acting. When my son wanted to study at Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, I told him it was his call. I believe in this day and age, spontaneity works. All the younger generation are spontaneous actors.\n\nI\u2019ve been told by mimicry artistes that I am a very difficult actor to imitate because I do not have a particular style. In my generation, all the actors had their individual styles, I didn\u2019t. People could imitate my dances because they were choreographed but not my acting. Acting is like riding a bicycle.\n\nThey say once you learn to ride, even if you haven\u2019t ridden for years, when you get on a bicycle, you might wobble for a bit and then you find your balance. Acting is like that you never lose your craft. There are no good or bad actors, only actors and non-actors.\n\nYou are known to be impatient and short tempered\u2026\n\nYes, but for Kapoor & Sons , I\u2019d sit in a chair for make-up for hours on end. You tell me does that make me patient or impatient?\n\nIt depends, yes I am irritable and if you ask me to stare at this poster for 15 minutes I would lose patience. I was willing to put in the time for Kapoor & Sons because of passion. I am a man of the moment. I do not have nerves of steel to quietly take whatever life dishes out.\n\nHave you regretted any of your outbursts?\n\nNever.\n\nWhat is it about acting that still excites you after all these years?\n\nI had reached saturation with singing and dancing around trees. I wasn\u2019t enjoying myself. Now I play characters \u2014 good, evil I enjoy them all. I enjoy the process of acting, of reinventing myself.\n\nCould you name some of your memorable performances?\n\nNo, I leave that for others to judge. Good, bad, indifferent, I chose to act in those movies. No one put a gun to my temple and forced me to act. I acted in those films to the best of my capacity. It is my job and I have to do it well. Acting in a film is not a favour, that is what I am paid to do. I tell my son also, you are supposed to be good, you have been paid for it.\n\nWhat does marriage mean to you?\n\nIt is a commitment. Neetu and I played according to the rules we set. I have been accused of not allowing Neetu to act after marriage. That is not true.\n\nIn a marriage, one person is the breadwinner and the other is a homemaker.\n\nIn our marriage, I was the breadwinner and I am very lucky Neetu was the homemaker. I know I am a difficult and painful man. Neetu was the shock absorber and I am thankful for that. She has kept me going.\n\nAre you a people person?\n\nI have to be, but I am not overtly friendly, I am not very accessible to fans, I do not seek attention. It is a failing, but that is how I am.\n\nDo you watch films?\n\nOf course I do! Cinema is my second mother.\n\nYou are publishing your autobiography Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored \u2026\n\nI am excited and nervous about it. I have been working on it for three years. It is published by Harper Collins and will be launched at The Hindu Lit for Life 2017.\n\nI am looking forward to it. While there have been books on the Kapoors, there has never been one by a Kapoor. There is nothing boring in the book, but don\u2019t look for scandal and sensation in it. I talk about my life, my failures, successes, all facets of films, things I\u2019ve enjoyed.\n\nDo you think nationalism is vastly different from patriotism?\n\nTo me, they are the same. I love my country. What I am is thanks to this land and the people.\n\nYou have come often to Bangalore. Do you have a favourite Bangalore memory/place?\n\nOh there are so many in Bangalore and Karnataka. We shot Mera Naam Joker in Mysore, Bobby in Bangalore, Zehreela Insaan, the remake of the famous Kannada film Naagarahaavu , in Chitradurga, parts of Satyam Shivam Sundaram , Prem Rog \u2026 Karnataka was a favourite of RK Studios.

Like always, such grandeur of envisioning a world vast and beyond always leaves me heavy in the throes of an existential crisis. That or the lack of a 4G network \u2013 both.\n\nIn the midst of all those \u2018why are we here\u2019 and \u2018what does it all matter\u2019 questions, I can\u2019t help but wonder about the pettiness that we occupy ourselves with. How we allow ourselves to fall for beliefs and notions that are nothing but a man-made construct. Religion. Time. Money. And somewhere down the pecking order, the belief that whisky is superior to whiskey.\n\nNow, we understand the purist\u2019s obsession with single malts and the special scoff they reserve for anything that isn\u2019t. One is also not entirely unfamiliar with the new, almost-hipster Bourbon brigade, who put down the Scotch enthusiasts like an endangered species. And let\u2019s not forget the new-age revolutionaries who will back any whisky (or whiskey) as long as it comes from a seemingly obscure country: India. Iceland. Italy. Even France! How about Tasmania down under?\n\nBut we often forget a country that sits on the cusp of all these factions: Irish whiskey. While it is true that most famous Irish distilleries were set up by Scotsmen, let\u2019s not forget that, historically, the art of distilling was brought by Irish monks to the Gaelic Bravehearts in the first place.\n\nThat said, the Irish style of whiskey is unique and very different from any else found around the world. To generalise, Scotch tends to be smoky and toasty, and Bourbon, at the other end of the spectrum, leans towards vanilla and butterscotch, and most other styles (Japanese and such) emulate one of the two with the local weather and master blender providing the nuanced differentiation.\n\nIrish whiskey then, by the same generalisation, is fairly neutral. It is smooth without being toasty, fruity without being ripe. It doesn\u2019t do peat, nor does it do new charred casks. Their idea of whiskey is to make a flavourful easy beverage that does well by itself and also marries well in cocktails. It should appeal to the novice, but also have complexity enough to engage the seasoned tippler. Recently, I was privy to an extended tasting by a popular Irish whiskey brand, Jameson, and these notes are pretty much from my scribbles on that evening.\n\nBut flavour aside, what I really like about them is how they have chosen to reach out to their patrons: no stuffy tastings, no elaborate meal pairings, or men in kilts being paraded through banquets full of thirsty aficionados. Instead, they are looking at more contemporary events and animations to engage people. Even an underground music fest was fair ground for them! Who would have thought that one day we would be enjoying the up-tempo beats of top international DJs with a measure of Jameson and ginger ale?\n\nAnd that is precisely how we should take life: always ready for the unexpected. To enjoy each unanticipated moment without classifying or judging. And as long as the glass has a double pour in it, don\u2019t worry whether it\u2019s whisky or whiskey.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967676.ece/BINARY/31mp_magan.ART_+G39125FDS.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Magandeep Singh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/A-matter-of-E/article16967789.ece", "title": "A matter of E"}, {"text": "I took my first selfie 11 years ago when I had just created my blog and needed a profile picture to go with it. It was taken with a webcam that was slightly bigger than a ping-pong ball, and whose resolution was poorer than the camera of the cheapest phone you get today. But the fact that you could take your own picture at the click of the mouse was mighty exciting, and so, purely in memory of those happy days, I have retained that picture on my blog, even though I barely resemble the man in it.\n\nThereafter, I took countless other selfies with the conventional camera, especially when wife and I would travel: I would put one arm around her and hold the camera with the other, pointing the lens in our direction and \u2014 with some mental calculation \u2014 making sure we were in the frame. Since we couldn\u2019t see ourselves on the display screen, we did not adjust our hair or alter our expressions to look our best: we merely smiled and looked at the lens. Some of our happiest pictures \u2014 whether spontaneously happy or happily spontaneous, I am not sure \u2014 were self-clicked in this fashion.\n\nSo, what the kids are doing today, I have been doing for more than a decade now; only that I did not know back then that such a self-clicked photograph would soon acquire a name, recognised by even the Oxford dictionary: selfie. Needless to say, the venerated dictionary, in keeping with the changing times, defines the \u2018selfie stick\u2019 as well, that too with great clarity: \u2018A device in the form of a rod on which a camera or a smartphone may be mounted, enabling the person holding it to take a photograph of themselves from a wider angle than if holding the camera or smartphone in their hand.\u2019\n\nSelfies are a way of life today. Many of us aren\u2019t even sure whether we live to selfie \u2014 or selfie to live? I have taken the liberty to use selfie as a verb because that\u2019s how it is, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the smartphone-owning society is split into two these days: people who live healthy so that they look naturally good when selfies are taken, and people who feel healthy when their selfies earn widespread admiration on social media.\n\nI don\u2019t know which category I belong to, but I would certainly find it very worrisome if I appeared to be \u2018smart\u2019 and \u2018fit\u2019 \u2014 even if not so in real life \u2014 with the help of the lens. The lens is capable of lying through its teeth, provided you know in which angle to hold the phone: a tubby man, therefore, can look trim \u2014 and once the \u2018likes\u2019 start pouring in, he actually begins to believe that he is in great shape when he isn\u2019t.\n\nWe now live in a world of illusions \u2014 or maya \u2014 something that the sages had always cautioned us against: a protruding tummy looks flat, whereas a perfect pair of feminine lips protrudes. Tonight, when you go partying, no matter where you go, look around: you will find countless pairs of lips protruding as the cameras are turned into the selfie mode \u2014 that is, if you are already not among those who like to pout.\n\nThe practice has become so common that no one any longer bats an eyelid when they find a young woman suddenly stopping in the middle of anywhere and aiming the phone at herself to pout at the screen. As for the woman, during those few moments she spends clicking selfies, she becomes so oblivious to the people around her, as if she were in front of the restroom mirror.\n\nBut: why pout when clicking a selfie? That, to me, shall remain the unanswered question from 2016, even as I wish you a Happy 2017.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967691.ece/BINARY/31mpBG.ART_GRA1+GPH12ACT1.2.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Bishwanath Ghosh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Happy-2017-But-why-do-you-pout/article16967778.ece", "title": "Happy 2017!

Having already sung in Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi and Hindi, in his latest song \u201cDhaakad\u201d for Dangal , he captures the conviction of the sisters, while narrating their journey from their stint as amateur wrestlers to their entry into the Olympics. Through his throaty rough voice as he sings in Haryanvi manifesting the rugged landscape of the arenas, with clouds of dust surrounding the sisters as they stride forward, Raftaar\u2019s proclivity to use the medium of music to tell stories is restated.\n\nHowever, soon Raftaar is switching space! He has collaborated with Mortem Tyldum for the upcoming sci-fi movie Passengers, which features Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in a space journey. His song \u201cAadat\u201d, recorded in the same studio as the movie. After composing a song titled \u201cMother Nature\u201d for the UN Climate Change Summit in 2014, this is his second big overseas project.\n\nCalling himself a \u2018storyteller\u2019 and \u2018poet\u2019 instead of a rapper, the autodidact in him comes alive as he talks about his humble beginnings and flair for rhyming he realised early in childhood. With a singsong yet stentorian voice, the weight in his voice justifies compositions like \u201cDhaakad\u201d and \u201cStand Up\u201d.\n\nHere Raftaar talks about his first Hollywood project, his beginnings as a singer and the changing trends in the music industry.\n\nHow was the experience of working with the Passengers team? What led to the composition?\n\nThe entire process went in raftaar! It happened quite fast. I was in Goa and had to come to Mumbai the next day. The same night I got a call from the Passengers team asking me to compose a song for them. They said they wanted my signature elements in the composition. I couldn't believe in the beginning. I thought maybe it\u2019s a Hindi version of Passengers or some other project in the same name. But, when I told it\u2019s the same movieI got super excited.\n\nNo matter how successful you get with your art, you should always crave for more. Next day, I was on a flight to the US and wrote the song. We reached the studio where the movie was shot and recorded in the same studio. Within a span of 24 hours, everything was done, the video was edited as well.\n\nThe movie is about space and connection. How does your composition fit in?\n\nIt surely is about space, but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s about two people living in a secluded place. And Chris makes a beautiful statement in the film. He says that even if they were surrounded by people in a heavenly setting, he would have still chosen Jennifer. This is really hard hitting, and I have conveyed the emotions through my song.\n\nThe best part is that this it is my first love song. All my songs in the past have either been inspirational or party numbers. This is for the first time I have sung something romantic.\n\nHow was this experience different from composing a song in India?\n\nFor me, it was definitely not different. I did the same things I do for a Bollywood movie or a composition back home. But, for them, having a Hindi song in a Hollywood movie is different.\n\nWhat's your signature style? What\u2019s the thread that connects all your songs?\n\nI am a storyteller. If you listen to my songs, I always try to convey a story, send messages across. Even \u201cAadat\u201d follows the same pattern. I am telling the story of Pratt and Lawrence in the movie. If you pay attention to the lyrics, you\u2019ll easily get the storyline of the movie.\n\nWhat are the current trends and patterns you see in the music industry?\n\nSee, there is nothing permanent in the industry. Romantic songs come and fade away and some other genre takes over, and then there are times when people like listening to Sufi music. It\u2019s really tough to make anything survive for long in this atmosphere characterised by transience. This generation is so fast and people want to listen to new stuff constantly.\n\nWhat makes a rapper different from any other singer?\n\nThe element of storytelling for sure. A singer would normally use a piece of lyrics, combine it with chorus and indulge in a lot of repetition. However, rappers have the power to utter 16-32 bars of poetry straight away. It's straight storytelling. It's straight delivery of everything you want to say. We\u2019re poets, bro! I call myself a poet with a bit of swagger, I never call myself a rapper.\n\nYou sing in multiple languages. Which is the language you connect to the most and like to sing in?\n\nI have sung \u201cDhaakad\u201d in Tamil and Telugu as well. I am a Keralite (his real name is Dilin Nair) and my first language is Malayalam. I have studied in a boarding school in Haryana and also know Punjabi. So, if you see, no language in specific is my favourite. But, Hindi comes naturally to me and is my comfort zone. I feel quite comfortable with Haryanvi and Punjabi as well. And, even if someone asks me to sing in Bengali and is ready to help me with it, I'll go ahead and do it.\n\nWhat's your biggest inspiration?\n\nWell, it\u2019s my own struggle. I encountered rap when I listened to Eminem and Linkin Park for the first time in 9th standard. And, in childhood I was really good at rhyming. From realising that I am good at it in the 2nd standard to realising that it\u2019s much more than that; it's about being skilled, having word-play, and telling stories. I used to check out videos online and watch English music channels on TV regularly. I come from a very humble background. Both my parents were working. I had to come out of that social bracket and achieve something better. That pushed me to do it.\n\nWho\u2019s your favourite singer or rapper?\n\nMy favourite rapper is Jayceon Terrell Taylor, who goes by the stage name The Game. I also have his name tattooed on my hand.\n\nYou've sung different kinds of songs ranging from inspirational to party. What's your most preferred type?\n\nI love doing songs like \u201cDhaakad\u201d and \u201cToh Dishoom\u201d. Both of them are filled with messages. Talking about the income group I come from, it\u2019s very difficult to balance a glamourous lifestyle with my roots. But, honestly if given a choice, I would always want to do songs with messages.\n\nWhat are the associations and plans you have for 2017?\n\nMy song with A.R. Rahman is coming out soon. I have also done a dance song for Jolly LLB-2 , which is also their title track. There is also a song with Sunny Deol that I am doing. The first song I ever sang and danced on as a kid was from Narsimha , a Sunny Deol movie.

So we picked five top-notch authors \u2013 Ravi Subramanian, Preeti Shenoy, Anuja Chauhan, Salil Tripathi and Bhaskar Ghosh \u2013 and asked them to share what was on the top of their minds in 2016. We didn\u2019t limit them by time lines, numbers, geography, literary forms and genres. It was a tad difficult to convince them as Salil was in London in the midst of writing a book on Gujaratis and Ravi was on a holiday in a computer-free environment. Finally, what we get is a fine mix of fiction, non-fiction, translated works and graphic novels. Some are guided by taste, some by immediate concerns. It is amazing to know how Ian McEwan\u2019s novella helped Bhaskar Ghosh settle in after a journey and how Ravi, a banker who writes about tales of intrigue and betrayal in financial world, picks \u201cRamayana for Children\u201d to relax. And sometimes even children play a role in introducing seasoned authors to new forms as Preeti and Anuja admit.\n\nAnuja Chauhan\n\nI spent this year writing basically because I had a book submission deadline on the 30th of November, but I promised myself I would make up for it by reading like a madman in December. Nowadays, my go-to person on what to read is my 21-year-old daughter.\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood: A dark, disturbing take set in a Christian-Talibanised sort of America, all about what happens if a nation starts to take a holy book too literally. I found it troubling and angering and it reinforced all the issues I already have with organised religion.\n\nFangirl by Rainbow Rowell I thoroughly enjoyed the book which was another one of my daughter\u2019s recommendations, which proved yet again that it\u2019s wrong to label books as either literary or commercial because it was so light and so deep all at once.\n\nThen, as part of my research for \u201cBaaz\u201d, my novel about the Air Force, I read \u201cIndia's Wars\u201d by Arjun Subramaniam, which was informative as well as absorbing. \u201cEagles Over Bangladesh\u201d by PVS Jagan and Samir Chopra, which is filled with wonderfully detailed and anecdotal accounts of the air battle between India and Pakistan in 1971.\n\nBooks that I read this year which were published in 2016 include \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d (which I bought first-day first-show, finished in two hours and felt thoroughly dissatisfied with) and my mother-in-law Margaret Alva's autobiography \u201cCourage and Commitment\u201d, which gives a great ringside view of the working of the Congress Party in the 70s and 80s.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967821.ece/BINARY/31ndmpAuthors.A+GOA12EB2M.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["S Ravi"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/The-author%E2%80%99s-choice/article16967824.ece", "title": "The author\u2019s choice"}, {"text": "\u201cI took to cycling by chance. In January this year, I was bowled over by the new and fitter look of a work associate of mine. He told me that cycling on the Ring Road of our small town Rourkela, Odisha, had done the magic, and the cycling bug bit me instantly.\n\nAfter a quick research on equipment, I bought a cycle and the necessary gear, like helmet, gloves, jersey, lights, and most importantly, cycling shorts \u2014 life savers, especially for long-distance riding.\n\nI began by cycling 15 to 20 km within the industrial town, and gradually built up my stamina to cycle 50 km. It gave me the confidence and courage to go pedalling beyond city limits. I began exploring places \u2014 forest areas and no-traffic zones \u2014 normally inaccessible to four-wheelers. Chirping birds and lavish greenery were luxuries I was not able to afford inside the city.\n\nNature appreciation overtook my fitness drive as I realised no matter how many ever times I cycled the same route, it felt different. I even learnt to mend punctures.\n\nI founded a small group called Rourkela Riders and began exploring new destinations in the vicinity, and cycled at least 100 km thrice a week. Running the family business did not allow me much time to pursue cycling, even though I wanted to.\n\nMy turning point came when I registered for Brevet, a cycle marathon with specified distances and a time limit. In association with Audax India, a national organisation for cycling affiliated to ACP France, I went on my first brevet ride on November 20. The picturesque countryside with panoramic views of hills and jungles covered the 200 km from Rourkela to Barbil (with its rich iron ore deposits) and back, and I was required to complete the distance in 13.5 hours. I left at 5.30 a.m. and was back by 5 p.m., much ahead of the stipulated time.\n\nThe feeling of elation made me sign up for the next brevet challenge from Rourkela to Puri and back \u2014 400 km in 27 hours.\n\nIt was a humongous task because I had to cycle non-stop through the day and night on a busy highway. A group of 13, including cyclists from Rourkela and Bhubaneshwar, set out early on December 10. It was a foggy morning with low visibility that slowed us down, but by dinner time we had covered 270 km. We suffered a setback when one of our cyclists was hit by a car.\n\nI was 20 km ahead when I rushed back in a support car. It took us three hours to stabilise him.\n\nThe incident dampened our spirit, but I decided to continue with the expedition, without asking for injury time out. And I made it well within the stipulated time \u2014 in 26 hours \u2014 by sheer determination.\n\nSince then, my motivation to cycle has been at a new high. Cycling has changed my life in a way I had never imagined.\n\nApart from physical fitness, it has boosted my mental strength and earned me fame. In 2016, I totally clocked 5,000-plus km and have signed up for the 600-km brevet on January 15 from Vizag to Rajahmundry, to be completed in 40 hours.\n\nKushal Agarwal is a 29-year-old businessman based in Rourkela.\n\n(As told toSOMA BASU)", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967832.ece/BINARY/30mpididit.ART_+GKS12A64I.5.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Soma Basu"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Two-wheels-to-freedom/article16967834.ece", "title": "Two wheels to freedom"}, {"text": "The winter has finally set in and demonetisation may have upset the daily routine yet hotels and restaurants in Delhi/ NCR are all set to woo people to bid farewell to 2016 in style.\n\nFor those wishing to make the most of the chilly weather by sitting around a bonfire, Fio Country Kitchen has arranged a perfect night out. In the warmth of magical fairy lights and the lush ambience of the Garden of Five Senses with flames dancing across a lavish spread of choicest hors d\u2019oeuvres and unlimited spirits, it offers quality time to cosy up with near and dear ones.

These include 1911, San Gimignano, The Spice Route and Daniell\u2019s Tavern .\n\nThere are many who feel bored attending just one celebration. So for these folks the place to head is the Tabula Beach Cafe and Arriba Mexican Grill & Tequileria which is doing two New Year parties. The two restaurants will ensure that patrons have different experiences as Tabula\u2019s \u201cDisco 82 - Retro Bollywood Night\u201d promises plenty of dancing and action with of course unlimited global cuisines and drinks. The Mexican Fiesta at Arriba provides the Spanish ambience with Spanish Mexican dance music, a tequila and margarita bar, live Mexican grill and an extensive salsa bar.\n\nNew Year Eve partying is not confined to grown ups as kids too accompany their parents. Besides music and live performances Raftaar Lounge and Bar, Punjabi Bagh, has arranged fire show and juggling by professional artists right at the table to mesmerise kids.

Vivanta by Taj, Gurgaon takes up the Bollywood theme to present Lights, Camera, Action! with Shivpal spinning latest Hindi film and bhangra numbers. Those wanting variety can head to other restaurants at the hotel where band Swastik will be performing.\n\nFor the tired souls who after an hectic night of partying on New Year\u2019s Eve need to get recharged for partying on first, Dirty Apron brings the detox Sunday brunch. Redefining the Sunday brunch on the very first day of the New Year it will provide an open air experience besides Deer Park warmed by a wood-fired oven in one corner, and a bar along one side of the space. This is one brunch where you get to dig into the amazing smoky and juicy flavours of barbecue specials hot off the grill.\n\nPark Plaza Noida makes a great offer to people who do not want to go home after partying on New Year Eve. They offer a package which allows one night stay for a couple in along with breakfast on New Year.

Being older than the average stand-up artist in India, his wacky outlook on everyday aspects of life combined with a straight faced dead pan delivery has made Maheep a stand out face in Indian stand up circuit.\n\nWhen asked about what he feels about the New Year, he remarks, \u201cFor me, my year ended on 28th December. Now, there is no pressure on me. People, unnecessarily put themselves under a lot of pressure and stress just so that they can show others that they had fun. All this stress I have done away with.\u201d\n\nHe jokingly continues, \u201cIn India, people take stress for things that we don\u2019t even know about or practise. I see that on Christmas, some Sharmaji will propose to his girlfriend. I don\u2019t get it. Same with the Valentine\u2019s Day, I believe 20 percent of marriages are proposed because of the pressure of February 14. Someday I want to see people in the US be this serious about celebrating Janmashtami or Ganesh Chaturthi.\u201d\n\nMaheep\u2019s humour encapsulates a lot of self-deprecating humour which was evidenced when we asked him how 2016 went for him. \u201cAs a person, 2016 has been very good to me. I firmly believe that if you are an optimist or an enthusiast, you will be disappointed more. I am neither of those. When I take the Metro in the morning, if I get a seat, I am very happy. This is true with ugly people also, they are always happy, whereas good looking people are sad because they keep expecting people to compliment them. Ugly people don\u2019t expect anything, so they are happy with whatever they get. Since not only am I ugly, I am also pessimistic, I have had a wonderful year!\u201d\n\nBut for Maheep, who regards Charlie Chaplin and Johnny Walker as his favourite comedians, 2016 also gave him ample material for his performance. \u201cAs a comedian I have to thank all the politicians for continuing to give us such good material.\u201d\n\nThe talk turned towards demonetisation, and how a comedian handles it. \u201cThe regular citizen in me agrees with it. But the comedian in me is enjoying it a lot. So earlier I never used to go to the ATM much. There was never too much need for it. But now since it is not so available and human tendency is to go after the things which we can\u2019t easily get, I have jumped with the bandwagon and stand in queues for the ATM way more than I did before the currency change. This is because whenever you stand at the ATM queue, you always get some material as something or the other keeps happening, while you wait. For example, if you don\u2019t choose English on the ATM machine, the person behind you will judge you. I have seen blue collar workers who have never spoken a word of English choosing English in the ATM machine. I have seen this happening.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cI don\u2019t have much money, because let\u2019s face it, I am a comedian. But when I stand at that ATM queue and I get to complain about the upper limits of cash withdrawal, it makes me feel I belong. The reality is very different as the upper limit is really how much money I might have in my entire account.\u201d\n\nBut India wasn\u2019t the only country to be joked at this year. \u201cI firmly believe that the person most surprised by the US election is Donald Trump himself. I also think he is the most scared. I keep expecting him to make an announcement saying that all this was a joke.\u201d\n\n(Maheep Singh will perform at The Roseate House, New Delhi on the New Year\u2019s Eve.)", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967749.ece/BINARY/31ndmpMaheep.AR+GTI12CU46.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Arvind Manoharan"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Was-it-a-joke/article16967800.ece", "title": "Was it a joke?"}, {"text": "Shahid and Mira Kapoor will be the second couple onKoffee with KaranSeason 5.With this being Mira\u2019s first TV appearance, the next episode this Sunday promises to give fans a glimpse into the couple\u2019s perfect life.

Those flirty ruffles in shirts and balloon sleeves aren\u2019t the only outcome of the global Victorian fashion obsession we\u2019ve been experiencing all season. Fashion critics say the luxe fabric will star at all New Year\u2019s Eve parties that matter, on both men and women. \u201cThis time of the year, expect OTT. Look for voluminous sleeves, \u201880s details and a lot of bling. Fortunately, the makeup is toned down, with just a strong mouth or brow. And the hair stays natural with a messy pulled-back look,\u201d begins Krishna Mukhi, stylist and former Fashion Features Director atHarper\u2019s Bazaar India.\n\nHere\u2019s breaking down the dress code for the night ahead:\n\nVelvet reloaded: Metal and velvet \u2014 you could do either one or both. High-octane glamour from Balmain, Gucci and Givenchy make the cut this season, but if you are partial to Indian designers, Huemn, the inventive Rajesh Pratap Singh and Atsu are the labels to hunt down. \u201cHuemn did \u201880s nostalgia very well at fashion weeks this year, with distinctive fur accents,\u201d continues Krishna. At the online fashion address, Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop, the label\u2019s black-and-gold cutdana embroidered gown, at Rs. 65,500, is a keeper. Meanwhile, the store\u2019s founder, Pernia Qureshi, also votes for Atsu\u2019s panelled, lace-up and one-shoulder wrap dresses in black. \u201cAtsu\u2019s clothes are feminine and chic and they fit like a glove. Both he and Shivan & Narresh did their best collection at Lakme this year,\u201d she insists. Her website has had many takers for Shivan & Narresh\u2019s palazzos with gold skein work.\n\nBerry fantastic: Blackest blackcurrant it is. Deep, dark and dramatic hues were undeniably the biggest trend for lips this season, and Krishna references the berry-like mouths on show at Rodarte, Marni and Erdem. \u201cMany of our Indian designers did it too, but the most striking of all were the lacquered black-cherry pouts at Louis Vuitton and Dior, the latter created with Dior\u2019s Rouge Dior in Poison coated with Dior Addict Ultra Gloss for a mirror finish. My personal favourite, though, is MAC\u2019s Cyber,\u201d she adds.\n\nFor the eyes, glitter and metallic updates are inevitable in the corner of the eye or near the cheekbones, but we\u2019re betting on the berry eye (wine shades) seen on Emanuel Ungaro\u2019s models at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year.\n\nBoots on board: You can\u2019t take thigh-high boots and slits out of the party circuit, but chunky platforms and strappy feminine sandals are definitely in. \u201cIf you plan to go partying in flats, they must have an element of glamour, with jewelled or faux leather detail. There is baroque too, toned down,\u201d says Krishna, pulling out images of velvet loafers from Miu Miu.\n\nInstant shine : For pocket-friendly last-minute purchases, like Bansri\u2019s body harness or Outhouse\u2019s chokers, try Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop and multi-designer stores in the city.\n\nMen\u2019s style\n\nJacket check : \u201cCarry the right attitude. This is the best accessory any man can ever possess!\u201d is sartorial savant Rohit Bal\u2019s blunt advice to our party-ready man. Some cajoling later, \u201cIt depends on what kind of party it is. I would suggested fitted and flared anarkali shapes under a sherwani or a long jacket for an occasion. A well-fitted leather jacket made to your size is a must-have. You can carry it off in a number of ways.\u201d\n\nAnother winner, Huemn\u2019s bomber jackets from Amazon India Fashion Week in October.\n\nThe custom suit : Borrow a few pointers on dressing sharp from Mumbai\u2019s suit expert, Troy Costa \u2013 everyone from actor Aamir Khan to Randeep Hooda is a fan. Someone else who swears by the \u201cbest to be overdressed rather than underdressed\u201d rule is Abhishek Paatni, the only new-age designer invited to showcase at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights this month. \u201cA custom peak lapel velvet blazer with a cotton shirt and pants would be my party look. To accessorise, throw in a lapel pin and a square. A nice pair of Oxford shoes in patent leather will complete your look,\u201d he promises.\n\nMale metallic: While tweed, wool, leather, suede and scuba will continue to rock the dance floor, Rajesh Pratap Singh\u2019s metal jacket is the most defining look of 2016. Check out artist Subodh Gupta in the \u2018steel\u2019 suit if you need convincing.\n\nMind the extras: Shantanu & Nikhil revived brooches for men, but in an edgier avatar, at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights.

I\u2019ve always had a personal connect with the music of my country.\u201d\n\nThe producer, composer and tabla player, known for creating an innovative fusion of classical Indian music and drum and bass, is the frontrunner of an electronica sub-genre called Asian Underground, and more recently as Indian and Asian electronica.\n\nApart from being an accomplished tabla player, he is also an electronic musician, music theorist, record producer and DJ. It was post his visit to India as a teenager to be trained under tabla maestro Acharya Pandit Laxman Singh that Talvin\u2019s musical journey kicked off.\n\nTalvin went on to rise to prominence as a tabla percussionist in the 1980s London music scene with strong influence from Classical Indian music. \u201cThere has been no turning back since then. Several experimental music collaborations with musical pioneers in various genres followed and a very strong Asian underground sub-culture movement was established. I went on to re-introduce the concepts of Indian classical music to western pop, dance and Jazz genres in the late 1980s and early 1990s as well.\u201d\n\nHis music, he says, is something that happened naturally to him. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of music that makes you want to explore it and I found my identity in it. It\u2019s the symbiosis of beat culture and sample culture. So it\u2019s literally a mash up of two diverse forms of music. I obviously owe a lot to Indian Classical music and at the heart of my music is a deeply rooted Indian cultural connection.\u201d\n\nDespite playing dance music, Talvin firmly believes EDM is really not what he tries to translate his passion into. \u201cMy music involves more spirit dancing. It\u2019s a serious form of electronic music. I like to keep my music on a developing path. It is constantly evolving which gives it a fresh perspective each time I play.\u201d\n\nThis year saw the tabla turntable talent rise to newer heights with a range of artistic ventures parallel to, and in conjunction with, his music career, including a film. \u201cThis year has been an amazing experience. I\u2019ve had a number of new projects to work on. The journey has been incredible and I\u2019m always grateful to get the opportunity to learn from others.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Talvin hopes to continue doing what he does best \u2013 making music \u2013 into 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a load of new enterprises lined up so there\u2019s plenty to be kicked about this coming year. There\u2019s also so much diversity in the music world today and that\u2019s something we all should look forward to this New Year.\u201d\n\nMy music involves more spirit dancing. It\u2019s a serious form of electronic music.\n\nMy music involves more spirit dancing.

The free-flowing number written by Pranav Chaganty (known for his rap songs in indie and film circles) is a guy\u2019s satirical take on love. Already a hit with online crowds, the number is Viswanath\u2019s effort to balance his music stint between movies and the indie arena. \u201cUltimately everything is music. With independent music, you realise it has no boundaries,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u2018Ducking Love\u2019 was his baby, both in musical structure and visualisation, but interesting collaborations with director Karthik Medikonda, choreographer Sunny added flesh to his skeletal idea. The song is raw and spontaneity is its USP. Telangana dialect, or say any language, isn\u2019t a challenge as long there\u2019s rhythm in what you produce, he remarks. \u201cI had produced three singles in the past, which couldn\u2019t release for several reasons. But, for this, things only got better with more people chipping in. While this was chapter one of the series, we plan to shoot the next video in Dubai,\u201d reveals Viswanath. He is extremely fond of musician Kamran\u2019s work in the indie-arena and hopes to establish a band soon.\n\nViswanath, who has worked in 17 films (including Tamil and Telugu) to date, uses social media as a tool to spot interesting music trends and scout talents for his movie work. Though his career grew on movies, the medium wasn\u2019t his first priority, initially he had been more curious about sound design. The musician brought up in Chennai has his own state-of-the-art music studio in Hyderabad where he stays for days and needs to be reminded to return home occasionally (laughs).\n\nHe remains grateful to his family for understanding his creative pursuits. Currently in the US to shop gadgets for his studio, he has his hands full when he returns to work for four films at once, the prominent one being the Telugu film Tarajuvvalu , directed by Mahesh Kathi.\n\nUltimately everything is music.

We went around the sun one more time. What I don\u2019t understand is, why are we celebrating it as if it is some sort of an achievement by us humans. Clearly, we didn\u2019t have a choice no? Gravity held us here and so we stayed. Otherwise, Chennai folks would have drifted off to another planet and put their kids into a \u2018strict\u2019 engineering college in Jupiter or some such. That would\u2019ve been a real achievement.\n\nBut I digress. I wanted to talk about celebrating New Year\u2019s. Or more specifically, about New Year\u2019s Eve parties. Boss, who in their right mind spends money to usher in the New Year yaar! I understand that we have all been told people are supposed to do \u2018cool\u2019 things. Like sliding chest-down along a table like Kamal Haasan, screaming \u2018Hi everybodyyy\u2019 in S.P. Balasubrahmanyam\u2019s voice, but you only ended up crashing on your younger sibling sitting on the other side of the table, thereby earning a thunderous thud on your back by one of your parents. Not the ideal way to welcome a New Year.\n\nOr trying to be like the \u2018cool\u2019 kids in the movie Anjali , who wear sneakers inside the house, sneak out of their apartments in the middle of the night and go around the city singing songs with strangers. I tried doing that once (it was not even New Year\u2019s Eve and it was not even midnight) and yet I was caught in the act before even moving out of the bed, for I was sleeping next to my grandmother, who slept with her eyes open. In the days before technology, my grandmother was a CCTV camera, GPS monitoring system and voice-based alarm mechanism all rolled into one.\n\nSo on December 31, at best, our apartment residents association would put up a \u2018variety show\u2019 and distribute potato chips and Rasna. So much for \u2018partying\u2019. A few years later, while in college, there were rumours about how my friend\u2019s friend\u2019s cousin\u2019s neighbours were part of this \u2018awesome\u2019 New Year party, and how they all counted down and rang in the New Year in great style. Interestingly, no one you knew directly ever went to these parties. There was also this \u2018cool gang\u2019 that boasted of having gone to Goa to party all the way through New Year\u2019s Eve. There were also terms such as \u2018farm house parties\u2019, \u2018beach house parties\u2019 thrown at us poor kids, who didn\u2019t even understand what they meant. It was all a grand mystery, and yet I badly wanted to be a part of it.\n\nWhile all my parents wanted was a simple university rank and a gold medal out of me, all I wanted was to get invited to at least one New Year party. It was around this age when the newspapers were also full of advertisements with captions such as \u2018New Year Bash\u2019 or \u2018New Year Gala\u2019. Entry for such parties was priced slightly less than the going rate for a kidney or a liver, which unfortunately were already pledged for my engineering education. It became my life\u2019s goal to attend at least one New Year party.\n\nNow, many years later, even though I earn enough to afford an occasional litre of petrol, the mysterious New Year party continues to elude me. A few days back, I came across another ad that said \u2018New Year\u2019s eve midnight dinner buffet\u2019 and my first thought was, \u2018Who in their right mind eats dinner buffet at midnight?\u2019 A few seconds later, my second thought was \u2018OK, I have to go to this buffet now\u2019. I decided to splurge and called up the fine-dining restaurant to reserve a table for two. The manager promised me a table at 10 p.m. sharp on December 31, 2018. I laughingly appreciated his sense of humour, to which he replied, with the seriousness of a cardiac-surgeon, that their restaurant was booked for the next two years.\n\nWhat?! Who are these strange human beings who reserve dinner tables two years in advance? I politely cancelled my reservation and decided to try other places for mediocre mass-cooked food and diluted drinks at hyper-inflated prices. I received a similar response everywhere. People had already signed up to spend unnecessary amounts of money, thereby denying me the chance to do the same.\n\nSo, I am waiting as the earth begins one more revolution around the sun. Hopefully, next year, I will be invited to a \u2018New Year Gala Bash.\u2019 And while we wait for another 365 days, here\u2019s wishing everyone a great laughter-filled 2017.\n\nThe Local Tea Party is a popular blogger known for his quirky prose.

Excerpts\n\nHave you always been\n\nso outspoken?\n\nAre you referring to my conversation two minutes ago or to my comments on Twitter?\n\nOn Twitter\n\nTwitter for me is fun. I don\u2019t take it too seriously. I like to make people happy. Most often I am the butt of the joke. I don\u2019t make fun of people. I try not to hurt anyone. I don\u2019t resent anyone. If, however, I have hurt anyone, I apologise, I say I am sorry.\n\nI have become sceptical about voicing my opinions now and only come out if I see injustice like in the case of my niece\u2019s child.\n\nDon\u2019t they say being outspoken and non-diplomatic in Bollywood is like committing hara-kiri?\n\nNo, this is who I am. Standards are set all the time of what is acceptable and what is not.\n\nDid you always want\n\nto become an actor?\n\nAs far as I can remember. I come from a family of actors. We are steeped in it. I am thankful to god that I have been able to carry the legacy forward.\n\nAre you a method actor?\n\nNot at all! I am a spontaneous actor, an instant coffee, instant noodle kind of actor. I respect all schools of acting. When my son wanted to study at Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, I told him it was his call. I believe in this day and age, spontaneity works. All the younger generation are spontaneous actors.\n\nI\u2019ve been told by mimicry artistes that I am a very difficult actor to imitate because I do not have a particular style. In my generation, all the actors had their individual styles, I didn\u2019t. People could imitate my dances because they were choreographed but not my acting. Acting is like riding a bicycle. They say once you learn to ride, even if you haven\u2019t ridden for years, when you get on a bicycle, you might wobble for a bit and then you find your balance. Acting is like that you never lose your craft. There are no good or bad actors, only actors and non-actors.\n\nYou are known to be\n\nimpatient and short\n\ntempered\u2026\n\nYes, but for Kapoor & Sons , I\u2019d sit in a chair for make-up for hours on end. You tell me does that make me patient or impatient? It depends, yes I am irritable and if you ask me to stare at this poster for 15 minutes I would lose patience. I was willing to put in the time for Kapoor & Sons because of passion. I am a man of the moment. I do not have nerves of steel to quietly take whatever life dishes out.\n\nWhat is it about acting that still excites you after all these years?\n\nI had reached saturation with singing and dancing around trees. I wasn\u2019t enjoying myself. Now I play characters \u2014 good, evil I enjoy them all. I enjoy the process of acting, of reinventing myself.\n\nCould you name some of\n\nyour memorable\n\nperformances?\n\nNo, I leave that for others to judge. Good, bad, indifferent, I chose to act in those movies. No one put a gun to my temple and forced me to act. I acted in those films to the best of my capacity. It is my job and I have to do it well. Acting in a film is not a favour, that is what I am paid to do. I tell my son also, you are supposed to be good, you have been paid for it.\n\nWhat does marriage\n\nmean to you?\n\nIt is a commitment. Neetu and I played according to the rules we set. I have been accused of not allowing Neetu to act after marriage. That is not true. In a marriage, one person is the breadwinner and the other is a homemaker. In our marriage, I was the breadwinner and I am very lucky Neetu was the homemaker.\n\nI know I am a difficult and painful man. Neetu was the shock absorber and I am thankful for that. She has kept me going.\n\nDo you like to cook?\n\nOnly stories! I cannot even boil water!\n\nAre you a people person?\n\nI have to be, but I am not overtly friendly, I am not very accessible to fans, I do not seek attention. It is a failing, but that is how I am.\n\nDo you watch films?\n\nOf course I do! Cinema is my second mother.\n\nYou are publishing your autobiography Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored \u2026\n\nI am excited and nervous about it. I have been working on it for three years. It is published by Harper Collins and will be launched at The Hindu Lit for Life 2017.\n\nI am looking forward to it. While there have been books on the Kapoors, there has never been one by a Kapoor. There is nothing boring in the book, but don\u2019t look for scandal and sensation in it. I talk about my life, my failures, successes, all facets of films, things I\u2019ve enjoyed.\n\nDo you think nationalism is vastly different from patriotism?\n\nTo me, they are the same. I love my country. What I am is thanks to this land and the people.\n\nAre you liberal or\n\nconservative?\n\nIt depends on the situation. In certain matters I could be orthodox; in others I could be unorthodox.\n\n(Rishi Kapoor will speak at The Hindu Lit for Life 2017. Festival dates: January 14-16.

You\u2019re going to be under CCTV surveillance...So what\u2019s tonight\u2019s party all about?\n\nThe pied pipers of parties, the Disc Jockeys are upbeat despite the restrictions. DJ Savio, who has been a pioneer in birthing and breeding a rocking party scene is pleased that hotels, party goers and the powers that be have come to a healthy understanding of what is fun and what\u2019s taboo. \u201cWe are happy with the rules. This only means that families can come to the party and will be safe. As a family person, I too want the same for others. Moreover, my 13-year-old daughter Celine is also performing and I would like her to be secure,\u201d says Savio, who will be playing at Hotel Gateway.\n\nWhat he wishes from party goers and the rest watching the scene is to be positive about such developments as it only ensures a safer party scene. \u201cCome over, support us and have a good time,\u201d he says.\n\nDJ Ryan, who will be playing at The Sky Grill, Crowne Plaza, agrees with Savio. Since hotels are focussing on family crowds for the parties, the excitement is still on, he says. \u201cThere is a sense of safety now and people are bound to have a good time.\u201d\n\nRyan has been a DJ for over 13 years in Kochi and he says the city had seen times when the party used to go on till 3 a.m. This time around, 12.30 a.m. and it is going to be a wrap. Ryan says the music would also be tweaked slightly to suit the preferences of families. \u201cPeople should know at least a couple of tracks. I thought I\u2019ll concentrate on commercial dance music this time with a lot of popular Bollywood remixes.\n\nSo what if the bar closes at 10 p.m. asks Raju Kannampuzha, Secretary of the Event Management Association of Kerala. The party time has been extended to 12.30 a.m. and it is reason enough to cheer, he says. \u201cThere is no need to feel that the fun has gone out of the New Year\u2019s Eve bash. On the contrary, there is a sense of security this time around. There has been no dip in the number of parties that are being held this year. So, I guess all you need to do is get out and shake a leg.\u201d The parties are waiting, there\u2019s great food to be had and great dancing to be done. DJ Ram Nair who will be leading the revellers at \u2018Sensation Black\u2019 in Hotel Casino says that such orders are signs of a growing city. \u201cThese are growing pains, other cities too have faced this and dealt with it. We too will do so. Hyderabad faced a ban on psychedelic music, Bangalore and Chennai too have been through this. Now it is Kochi\u2019s turn.\u201d\n\nBut Ram like others believe it to be a good move, if it helps the authorities deal with a bigger menace of substance abuse and of dark rave parties.\n\nSo join the party, the night\u2019s still young.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967715.ece/BINARY/31komp-party.MP+G6V12BKAE.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Anasuya Menon", "Priyadershini S"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Ring-in-the-new/article16967887.ece", "title": "Ring in the new"}, {"text": "If you haven\u2019t hopped on to the velvet train yet, tonight\u2019s your chance. Those flirty ruffles in shirts and balloon sleeves aren\u2019t the only outcome of the global Victorian fashion obsession we\u2019ve been experiencing all season. Fashion critics say the luxe fabric will star at all New Year\u2019s Eve parties that matter, on both men and women. \u201cThis time of the year, expect OTT. Look for voluminous sleeves, \u201880s details and a lot of bling. Fortunately, the makeup is toned down, with just a strong mouth or brow. And the hair stays natural with a messy pulled-back look,\u201d begins Krishna Mukhi, stylist and former Fashion Features Director atHarper\u2019s Bazaar India.\n\nHere\u2019s breaking down the dress code for the night ahead:\n\nVelvet reloaded: Metal and velvet \u2014 you could do either one or both. High-octane glamour from Balmain, Gucci and Givenchy make the cut this season, but if you are partial to Indian designers, Huemn, the inventive Rajesh Pratap Singh and Atsu are the labels to hunt down. \u201cHuemn did \u201880s nostalgia very well at fashion weeks this year, with distinctive fur accents,\u201d continues Krishna. At the online fashion address, Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop, the label\u2019s black-and-gold cutdana embroidered gown, at Rs. 65,500, is a keeper. Meanwhile, the store\u2019s founder, Pernia Qureshi, also votes for Atsu\u2019s panelled, lace-up and one-shoulder wrap dresses in black. \u201cAtsu\u2019s clothes are feminine and chic and they fit like a glove. Both he and Shivan & Narresh did their best collection at Lakme this year,\u201d she insists. Her website has had many takers for Shivan & Narresh\u2019s palazzos with gold skein work.\n\nBerry fantastic: Blackest blackcurrant it is. Deep, dark and dramatic hues were undeniably the biggest trend for lips this season, and Krishna references the berry-like mouths on show at Rodarte, Marni and Erdem. \u201cMany of our Indian designers did it too, but the most striking of all were the lacquered black-cherry pouts at Louis Vuitton and Dior, the latter created with Dior\u2019s Rouge Dior in Poison coated with Dior Addict Ultra Gloss for a mirror finish. My personal favourite, though, is MAC\u2019s Cyber,\u201d she adds.\n\nFor the eyes, glitter and metallic updates are inevitable in the corner of the eye or near the cheekbones, but we\u2019re betting on the berry eye (wine shades) seen on Emanuel Ungaro\u2019s models at Paris Fashion Week earlier this year.\n\nBoots on board: You can\u2019t take thigh-high boots and slits out of the party circuit, but chunky platforms and strappy feminine sandals are definitely in. \u201cIf you plan to go partying in flats, they must have an element of glamour, with jewelled or faux leather detail. There is baroque too, toned down,\u201d says Krishna, pulling out images of velvet loafers from Miu Miu.\n\nInstant shine : For pocket-friendly last-minute purchases, like Bansri\u2019s body harness or Outhouse\u2019s chokers, try Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop and multi-designer stores like Amethyst and Evoluzione.\n\nMen\u2019s style\n\nJacket check : \u201cCarry the right attitude. This is the best accessory any man can ever possess!\u201d is sartorial savant Rohit Bal\u2019s blunt advice to our party-ready man. Some cajoling later, \u201cIt depends on what kind of party it is. I would suggested fitted and flared anarkali shapes under a sherwani or a long jacket for an occasion. A well-fitted leather jacket made to your size is a must-have. You can carry it off in a number of ways.\u201d Another winner, Huemn\u2019s bomber jackets from Amazon India Fashion Week in October.\n\nThe custom suit : Borrow a few pointers on dressing sharp from Mumbai\u2019s suit expert, Troy Costa \u2013 everyone from actor Aamir Khan to Randeep Hooda is a fan. Someone else who swears by the \u201cbest to be overdressed rather than underdressed\u201d rule is Abhishek Paatni, the only new-age designer invited to showcase at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights this month. \u201cA custom peak lapel velvet blazer with a cotton shirt and pants would be my party look. To accessorise, throw in a lapel pin and a square. A nice pair of Oxford shoes in patent leather will complete your look,\u201d he promises.\n\nMale metallic: While tweed, wool, leather, suede and scuba will continue to rock the dance floor, Rajesh Pratap Singh\u2019s metal jacket is the most defining look of 2016. Check out artist Subodh Gupta in the \u2018steel\u2019 suit if you need convincing.\n\nMind the extras: Shantanu & Nikhil revived brooches for men, but in an edgier avatar, at GQ \u2019s Fashion Nights. The magazine\u2019s editor, Che Kurrien, says Tom Ford\u2019s reinvention of a classic fragrance, the Tobacco Vanille, wins hands down this season. And for some quirk, he suggests you take the Adidas Originals Tubular X sneakers for a spin tonight. Top photographer and Kingfisher Calendar man, Atul Kasbekar, insists on self-tied bow ties, if you are going formal. \u201cTom Ford has a brilliant pre-tied bow that looks like you\u2019ve knotted it.

Claire Foy is stunning as a young woman with an immense burden on her shoulders. The show is visually arresting, tightly-scripted and is proof that story-telling is, and always will be, superior to big-budget special effects.

A mind-bending storyline with equally confounding twists and a cast that reads like an honour roll, no show this year is capable of making you stay up at night the way Westworld does. (Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nStranger Things : The Eighties are back with this eerie sci-fi mystery that plays like a Stephen King novel. Stranger Things boasts of not only Winona Ryder (who is flawless as a distraught mother trying to make sense of aliens in her backyard), but also the most lovable 10-year-olds in recent television history. (Netflix)\n\nThe Night Of: Dark and gripping, The Night Of is, to borrow from the show, a subtle beast. Naz Khan finds himself accused of a gory murder, and it doesn\u2019t help that he has no recollection of events. Riz Ahmed, John Turturro and Bill Camp are fantastic in this courtroom drama that makes no mince of discussing racial prejudice and Islamophobia in the backdrop of the American justice system.

Hugh Laurie transforms into Richard \u2018The Worst Man In The World\u2019 Roper, a billionaire weapons dealer, and Olivia Colman is brilliant as Angela Burr, the determined British enforcement agent who\u2019s out to catch him.

(Hotstar, Star World Premiere HD)\n\nBlack Mirror : The show is a compilation of six episodes, each narrating a different (horror) story detailing our relationships, and growing reliance on technology. Whether it\u2019s the story of killer robotic bees or a future where your worth is measured in \u2018likes\u2019, Black Mirror will have you looking at your phones very differently. (Netflix)\n\nBetter Call Saul (Season 2) : The show might be only two seasons old, but the spin-off has already outdone its much-celebrated original, Breaking Bad . The series about a small-time lawyer\u2019s path to becoming an ace con-man has excellent story-telling, sharp dialogue, terrific acting, and is one of the best shows on TV right now. (Colors Infinity)\n\nThe Americans (Season 4) : The thriller series about two Russian spies living average American lives during the peak of the Cold War only got better this year.

Not having gone to any of these places, the question on everyone\u2019s mind was \u201cso what else is there to see in China?\u201d Well, it was a whole different world out there, from giant pandas to UNESCO World Heritage Sites like the Jiuzhaigou National Park, which is a 72,000-hectare biosphere reserve, and Huanglong, which is the world-famous travertine landscape to the highest railway line in the world.\n\nThe best experience for me was travelling on the Qinghai Railway (Qinghai, pronounced as Chinghai, is a high-altitude Tibetan plateau). This railway line was built to connect the Tibetan city of Lhasa to China\u2019s vast rail network. The journey of 1,956 km is covered in 21 hours. Though spread across various elevations, the Tanggula railway station, at an elevation of 5,068 m (16,627 feet), makes it the highest railway station in the world. We crossed 675 bridges through 10 tunnels and 44 stations before reaching our destination at Xining. Another significant fact about the line is that 550 km of it is laid on permafrost (rock or soil that\u2019s solid icy during winter but mushy in summer).\n\nWe boarded the train in Lhasa, Tibet, where the train arrived 45 minutes prior to departure. As I entered the carriage, it seemed like just another first-class Indian train compartment. The corridor of the compartment is lined with foldable seats to let travellers get a better view from the windows. Small oxygen vents are placed at every few feet on the corridor to maintain the level of oxygen inside the train that\u2019s moving at such a high elevation. The air at these altitudes is much thinner, with the oxygen level being 40 to 50 per cent lower than that at sea level. Just visiting the plateau can make people pass out; hard physical activity at these heights can even prove fatal. We learnt that a major part of the construction from Lhasa to Golmud (1,142 km) was completed in five years.\n\nAs the train passed along the plateau, I was thrilled to see the beauty outside while sitting in the comfort of my warm cabin. We spotted a number of yaks grazing on what looked like snow-covered grass, the rare Tibetan antelope, a few wild asses and many snow-capped mountains. We passed by the beautiful and magnificent Cona Lake, which is sprawled over 409 square metres. Such flat sites at a height averaging 4,500 meters explained why the Tibetan plateau is often referred to as the \u2018Roof of the world\u2019. The only disappointment during the trip was not being able to catch a glimpse of the Tanggula railway station (the highest station in the word). The train does not stop at this station. We were eagerly waiting to take snaps of the station when the train passed by it, but unfortunately, found a goods train blocking our view. All the passengers sighed in disappointment.\n\nSome pointers for those who intend to try this 21-hour experience:\n\nlPack light. There isn\u2019t much space to accommodate big suitcases in the compact coupe.\n\nlCarry binoculars and a good camera with telephoto lens.\n\nlIf you\u2019re a vegetarian, carry instant noodles or ready-to-eat Indian food, as hot water is available on the train.\n\nlCarry sachets of coffee, tea and milk powder, as only yak milk is available. You can try yak yoghurt that tastes almost similar to cow\u2019s milk yoghurt, except it is much sweeter.\n\nlAvoid buying oxygen cans or oxygenated water, as there are plenty of oxygen outlets on the train, even in the coupes. Each couple gets four oxygen outlets; oxygen tubes are available on request.\n\nThe oxygen level at these altitudes is 40 to 50 per cent lower than it is at sea level", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967765.ece/BINARY/31mp_train_trav+GMA12BRHA.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Pooja Bhatt"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Somewhere-over-the-rail-line/article16967910.ece", "title": "Somewhere over the rail line"}, {"text": "Watch\n\nNew Year\u2019s Eve\n\nA noisy party not your cup of tea?

Like always, such grandeur of envisioning a world vast and beyond always leaves me heavy in the throes of an existential crisis. That or the lack of a 4G network \u2013 both.\n\nIn the midst of all those \u2018why are we here\u2019 and \u2018what does it all matter\u2019 questions, I can\u2019t help but wonder about the pettiness that we occupy ourselves with. How we allow ourselves to fall for beliefs and notions that are nothing but a man-made construct. Religion. Time. Money. And somewhere down the pecking order, the belief that whisky is superior to whiskey.\n\nNow, we understand the purist\u2019s obsession with single malts and the special scoff they reserve for anything that isn\u2019t. One is also not entirely unfamiliar with the new, almost-hipster Bourbon brigade, who put down the Scotch enthusiasts like an endangered species. And let\u2019s not forget the new-age revolutionaries who will back any whisky (or whiskey) as long as it comes from a seemingly obscure country: India. Iceland. Italy. Even France! How about Tasmania down under?\n\nBut we often forget a country that sits on the cusp of all these factions: Irish whiskey. While it is true that most famous Irish distilleries were set up by Scotsmen, let\u2019s not forget that, historically, the art of distilling was brought by Irish monks to the Gaelic Bravehearts in the first place.\n\nThat said, the Irish style of whiskey is unique and very different from any else found around the world. To generalise, Scotch tends to be smoky and toasty, and Bourbon, at the other end of the spectrum, leans towards vanilla and butterscotch, and most other styles (Japanese and such) emulate one of the two with the local weather and master blender providing the nuanced differentiation.\n\nIrish whiskey then, by the same generalisation, is fairly neutral. It is smooth without being toasty, fruity without being ripe. It doesn\u2019t do peat, nor does it do new charred casks. Their idea of whiskey is to make a flavourful easy beverage that does well by itself and also marries well in cocktails. It should appeal to the novice, but also have complexity enough to engage the seasoned tippler. Recently, I was privy to an extended tasting by a popular Irish whiskey brand, Jameson, and these notes are pretty much from my scribbles on that evening.\n\nBut flavour aside, what I really like about them is how they have chosen to reach out to their patrons: no stuffy tastings, no elaborate meal pairings, or men in kilts being paraded through banquets full of thirsty aficionados. Instead, they are looking at more contemporary events and animations to engage people. Even an underground music fest was fair ground for them! Who would have thought that one day we would be enjoying the up-tempo beats of top international DJs with a measure of Jameson and ginger ale?\n\nAnd that is precisely how we should take life: always ready for the unexpected. To enjoy each unanticipated moment without classifying or judging. And as long as the glass has a double pour in it, don\u2019t worry whether it\u2019s whisky or whiskey.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967676.ece/BINARY/31mp_magan.ART_+G39125FDS.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Magandeep Singh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/A-matter-of-E/article16967906.ece", "title": "A matter of E"}, {"text": "I took my first selfie 11 years ago when I had just created my blog and needed a profile picture to go with it. It was taken with a webcam that was slightly bigger than a ping-pong ball, and whose resolution was poorer than the camera of the cheapest phone you get today. But the fact that you could take your own picture at the click of the mouse was mighty exciting, and so, purely in memory of those happy days, I have retained that picture on my blog, even though I barely resemble the man in it.\n\nThereafter, I took countless other selfies with the conventional camera, especially when wife and I would travel: I would put one arm around her and hold the camera with the other, pointing the lens in our direction and \u2014 with some mental calculation \u2014 making sure we were in the frame. Since we couldn\u2019t see ourselves on the display screen, we did not adjust our hair or alter our expressions to look our best: we merely smiled and looked at the lens. Some of our happiest pictures \u2014 whether spontaneously happy or happily spontaneous, I am not sure \u2014 were self-clicked in this fashion.\n\nSo, what the kids are doing today, I have been doing for more than a decade now; only that I did not know back then that such a self-clicked photograph would soon acquire a name, recognised by even the Oxford dictionary: selfie. Needless to say, the venerated dictionary, in keeping with the changing times, defines the \u2018selfie stick\u2019 as well, that too with great clarity: \u2018A device in the form of a rod on which a camera or a smartphone may be mounted, enabling the person holding it to take a photograph of themselves from a wider angle than if holding the camera or smartphone in their hand.\u2019\n\nSelfies are a way of life today. Many of us aren\u2019t even sure whether we live to selfie \u2014 or selfie to live? I have taken the liberty to use selfie as a verb because that\u2019s how it is, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the smartphone-owning society is split into two these days: people who live healthy so that they look naturally good when selfies are taken, and people who feel healthy when their selfies earn widespread admiration on social media.\n\nI don\u2019t know which category I belong to, but I would certainly find it very worrisome if I appeared to be \u2018smart\u2019 and \u2018fit\u2019 \u2014 even if not so in real life \u2014 with the help of the lens. The lens is capable of lying through its teeth, provided you know in which angle to hold the phone: a tubby man, therefore, can look trim \u2014 and once the \u2018likes\u2019 start pouring in, he actually begins to believe that he is in great shape when he isn\u2019t.\n\nWe now live in a world of illusions \u2014 or maya \u2014 something that the sages had always cautioned us against: a protruding tummy looks flat, whereas a perfect pair of feminine lips protrudes. Tonight, when you go partying, no matter where you go, look around: you will find countless pairs of lips protruding as the cameras are turned into the selfie mode \u2014 that is, if you are already not among those who like to pout.\n\nThe practice has become so common that no one any longer bats an eyelid when they find a young woman suddenly stopping in the middle of anywhere and aiming the phone at herself to pout at the screen. As for the woman, during those few moments she spends clicking selfies, she becomes so oblivious to the people around her, as if she were in front of the restroom mirror.\n\nBut: why pout when clicking a selfie? That, to me, shall remain the unanswered question from 2016, even as I wish you a Happy 2017.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967691.ece/BINARY/31mpBG.ART_GRA1+GPH12ACT1.2.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Bishwanath Ghosh"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Happy-2017-But-why-do-you-pout/article16967890.ece", "title": "Happy 2017!

What are those small changes that would make our home a touch cosier and more streamlined? I\u2019ve noted down three key resolutions. Let\u2019s call them \u201cspacelutions\u201d for the fun of it, shall we? And the best part about house and home resolutions is you don\u2019t have to stop eating chocolate to achieve any of them!\n\nDeclutter\n\nStart by assessing all that you currently own and that\u2019s on display. Be it vases, photo frames, knick knack bowls, candles, and more. Once you take stock of it all, it becomes easier to cull what you truly want to keep. I love to pepper my living room with photos, but I do always make a mental note to keep it in check, so it doesn\u2019t make the space overwhelming. Similarly, maybe you don\u2019t need to display all your showpieces at once. Choose your current favourite and make that your star piece.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve got your key d\u00e9cor elements in place, vow to clean up those drawers that hold forgotten notes, old bills, bookmarks, medicines and more. Make catch-all baskets and trinket trays your best friend. Streamlining spaces that are visible is easy enough. But only once those little nooks and crannies are spruced up too do you feel like you can tick this resolution off your new year to-do list.\n\nStay get-together ready, always\n\nAt the turn of the new year, each of us vow to put in effort into spending quality time with our loved ones. So why not lend your home space that inviting feel? Starting in the new year, vow to make every living space get-together and guest-friendly. Small and simple changes help you achieve this in the most seamless of ways. Make sure that vase in your living room always has a bunch of fresh flowers. Take stock of old magazines that tend to pile up in the bathroom or bedroom and stow them away to give to the old paper mart. This helps in keeping your home clutter-free ever so often. Ensure you always have a clean set of bed and bath linen ready in the guest bedroom in case a relative pops by for a short stay. I also always fluff and switch up my couch and floor cushions so that they\u2019re always a tad lived-in and not entirely stiff for when guests pop over.\n\nKeep your d\u00e9cor elements seasonal\n\nIf you keep flowers at your foyer, apart from the year-round rotation of roses, orchids, and lilies, switch up and opt for flowers that are seasonal. Similarly for scented candles \u2013 in the summers, opt for tropical and sunny scents; maybe even choose tropical-inspired pieces to go with. Pick rain forest-esque scents for the monsoon and pine and cinnamon for the winters for that cosy, toasty feel. Doing this helps in bringing in and reflecting the current season indoors too.\n\nThe simplest things make the most impact. These are just three of many quick things you can do to get closer to a more \u2018spacelution\u2019-friendly home; one that is more inviting, more seasonal and definitely more clutter-free!\n\nHave a sparkling 2017!", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967679.ece/BINARY/31mp_sussanne.A+GRQ1259IC.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Sussanne Khan Is Style Editor At The Label Life"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Housekeeping-tips/article16967907.ece", "title": "Housekeeping tips"}, {"text": "Portfolio 2017, the 14th annual news photo exhibition, organised by Kochi Photo Journalists\u2019 Forum, is on at TDM Hall, Ernakulam.

Since hotels are focussing on family crowds for the parties, the excitement is still on, he says. \u201cThere is a sense of safety now and people are bound to have a good time.\u201d\n\nRyan has been a DJ for over 13 years in Kochi and he says the city had seen times when the party used to go on till 3 a.m. This time around, 12.30 a.m. and it is going to be a wrap. Ryan says the music would also be tweaked slightly to suit the preferences of families. \u201cPeople should know at least a couple of tracks. I thought I\u2019ll concentrate on commercial dance music this time with a lot of popular Bollywood remixes.\n\nSo what if the bar closes at 10 p.m. asks Raju Kannampuzha, Secretary of the Event Management Association of Kerala. The party time has been extended to 12.30 a.m. and it is reason enough to cheer, he says. \u201cThere is no need to feel that the fun has gone out of the New Year\u2019s Eve bash. On the contrary, there is a sense of security this time around. There has been no dip in the number of parties that are being held this year. So, I guess all you need to do is get out and shake a leg.\u201d The parties are waiting, there\u2019s great food to be had and great dancing to be done. DJ Ram Nair who will be leading the revellers at \u2018Sensation Black\u2019 in Hotel Casino says that such orders are signs of a growing city. \u201cThese are growing pains, other cities too have faced this and dealt with it. We too will do so. Hyderabad faced a ban on psychedelic music, Bangalore and Chennai too have been through this. Now it is Kochi\u2019s turn.\u201d\n\nBut Ram like others believe it to be a good move, if it helps the authorities deal with a bigger menace of substance abuse and of dark rave parties.\n\nSo join the party, the night\u2019s still young.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967902.ece/BINARY/31komp-party.AR+GCO12EN2P.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Anasuya Menon", "Priyadershini S"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Ring-in-the-new/article16967903.ece", "title": "Ring in the new"}]], ["Kozhikode", [{"text": "2016 has been a year that has been quite dramatic in real life, thanks to events such as the Brexit vote and the victory of Donald Trump in the election to the presidency of the United States, the highest political office on the planet.

From a company that was mocked for what seems like a silly product \u2013 sending photos and videos that disappear \u2013 to a company whose interface design has changed the way all tech products design their interfaces (for example, Instagram now has \u201cyour story\u201d which is like Snapchat but also all photo and video products, including WhatsApp\u2019s photo sharing, have text and emoji overlays).\n\nWhat are the events and trends that define 2016 on social media?\n\nGiven that most of the companies we identify and use as \u201csocial media\u201d are U.S. companies, the American presidential election has certainly been a massive media event. It has forced companies like Reddit, Facebook and Twitter to admit that issues such as fake news, trolling and misogyny are very serious challenges to online communication. In that sense, we are over the moment of celebrating social media\u2019s role in helping freedom of expression and are wondering how to make communication more meaningful online.\n\nWho, according to you, is the social media person/event of the year?\n\nA person who needs to be celebrated more is Nighat Dad, a Pakistani lawyer and digital rights activist who has successfully launched Pakistan\u2019s first online harassment helpline in 2016.\n\nHow do you see social media sites looking ahead to 2017 and beyond?\n\nI am particularly concerned about one platform \u2013 Twitter. Twitter\u2019s financial troubles in 2016 have laid bare the difference between making a useful technology product and a commercially successful technology company. Twitter remains a unique platform with fiercely loyal users, including presidents and prime ministers of countries \u2013 prompting the dangerous realisation that what we identify as public services are also entities with commercial interests. 2017 and beyond will see more battles over what is public, private and commercial.\n\nKrish Ashok, techie and blogger\n\nWhat has been the most innovative social media site of 2016?\n\nIn terms of innovation, Snapchat.\n\nWhat are the events and trends that define 2016 on social media?\n\n2016 has been a huge inflection point for social media. The election of Trump and Brexit comprehensively proved that no mainstream institution had the pulse of the people.\n\nSocial media echo chambers allowed the free and easy dissemination of both real and fake news, leading to a peak political polarisation of the population in many parts of the world.\n\nWho, according to you, is the social media person/event of the year?\n\nTrump, without a doubt.\n\nHow do you see social media sites looking ahead to 2017 and beyond?\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s very hard to predict. Facebook has a fake news problem and Twitter has a cyber bullying problem, but both of them will continue to grow and be relevant to any social media strategy in the near future. I think more niche networks like Snapchat will continue to push the boundaries in terms of new ideas like AI, augmented reality and devices. Interesting times ahead.\n\nV. Shakti, tech blogger and disability rights activist\n\nWhat has been the most innovative social media site of 2016?\n\nSnapchat takes the cake there. It is a very new and extremely young network that has thrived and grown on innovation and creativity. It has quickly unseated the other networks in terms of engagement and user base growth. Even brands are flocking to the network and trying to cash in on the highly active and creative user base there.\n\nWhat are the events and trends that define 2016 on social media?\n\nSadly, while there were many positive things that defined social media in 2016, I would say that 2016 has been a terrible year that saw the rise of mindless trolling and endless ideological struggle.\n\nIn India, it was even more pronounced than the rest of the world. The right and the left were constantly at each other\u2019s throats and meaningless tussles became the order of the day! There is massive pressure to take sides either way, and even families weren\u2019t spared of systematic abuse. I shudder to think what is in store if this ugly trend continues!\n\nWho, according to you, is the social media person of the year?\n\nThe average social media user, who is neither left or right, but is parked firmly in the centre!\n\nThey are the folks that need to be awarded for keeping their sanity\n\nHow do you see social media sites looking ahead to 2017 and beyond?\n\nMore photos, more videos, and we will see the paradigm shift to teensy writing and aggressive video sharing.\n\nEffectively giving us the attention span of a goldfish!", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16952113.ece/BINARY/26mpSocialmedia+GJP121G6R.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Nikhil Varma"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Throwing-light-on-2016-in-social-media/article16967912.ece", "title": "Throwing light on 2016 in social media"}, {"text": "So Taylor Swift rocked the look - doesn\u2019t mean you should try it for the New Year\u2019s party! Not all trends manage an Indian crossover. Some trends are better left overseas. We take a look at some of the trends that failed to make a mark.\n\nBronzer: This is the mother of all style statements that fail to bridge the west-east divide. There is no need to copy misguided celebs who don a toasty hue for every red-carpet appearance.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to be ashamed of who we are, ladies. Yup, we are brown-skinned. So piling on brown-tinted powder is redundant. Bronzer is used to fix complexions turning pasty-white from sun-deprivation in cold, snowy winters \u2014 a problem specific to Caucasian girls living in temperate countries. Give this one a miss.\n\nPink shimmery lipstick: This lingering remnant of the Eighties just ends up making your entire look seem tired and dated. Whether it is paired with a classic little black dress on New Year\u2019s Eve or a festive red Christmas dress, this shade of lip-colour is an epic fail. It also does absolutely nothing for Indian skin tones. Remember, this shade of pink is supposed to be a barely-there lip-colour for pink-and-white complexions. Indian skin tones have honey, apricot and olive undertones, which clash badly with light pinks, especially pink tints with a pearly sheen.\n\nHead-to-toe black for a day party: The reason this Italian Mafia-widow look doesn\u2019t bridge the cultural divide has nothing to do with our Indian complexions. It is just common sense. Sure, an Armani-inspired, monochrome black ensemble is a killer look. Always provided that the grey clouds outside give it a bit of a context. In the bright tropical sunshine, black dresses look utterly pointless, especially since many of the most haute lunch party venues are al-fresco or poolside. So keep your all-black outfit for a rainy day.\n\nBlonde streaks: Another chronically unsuccessful trend is the tabby-cat effect of pale, not-at-all-golden strands in the middle of a head of black or brown hair. Those mismatched stands can look startlingly wrong, especially when they are lighter than your face. Quite apart from creating a bizarre tiger-striped effect, this one stands out as a classic case of a colonial hangover. Not all cool people are foreign, and you don't need to be blonde, or partially blonde, to get noticed at a party. Make peace with your real hair.\n\nIt is okay if nobody mistakes you for a foreign tourist. Really.\n\nIndian skin tones have honey, apricot and olive undertones, which clash badly with light pinks, especially pink tints with a pearly sheen", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16952088.ece/BINARY/28bgmfashion.AR+GGM121G0J.4.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Radhika Sangam"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Not-making-the-cut/article16967913.ece", "title": "Not making the cut"}, {"text": "Rajeev Ravi\n\nKammatipadam\n\nRajeev Ravi simply pulled the comfort rug from under the feet of viewers accustomed to watching rom-coms and family dramas. His hard-hitting Kammatipadam was an eye-opener that tore away the veneer from our glittering cities. His third film as director, after Annayum Rasoolum and Njan Steve Lopez , plunged viewers into the underbelly of a city that had forgotten its past and its inhabitants.\n\nDileesh Pothan\n\nMaheshinte Prathikaram\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that a director\u2019s first film is talked with as much reverence as Dileesh and his debut, Maheshinte Prathikaram . A compelling tale of an ordinary man\u2019s sweet revenge, set in the rustic environs of Idukki, the film captured the attention of the audience. The director was lauded for his craft, his attention to detail and for drawing out the nuances of his characters, lead by the inimitable Fahadh Faasil. Truly deserving of that Kummatikka juice!\n\nSanal Sasidharan\n\nOzhivudivasathe Kali\n\nMade on a shoestring budget, Ozhivudivasathe Kali , a film noir on the vicious caste system and how it has seeped into every aspect of our lives, spares no one.\n\nMade in the backdrop of an election, the film, shot with almost all newcomers, delivers a punch with its stinging dialogues and peels away the skin of formality to reveal ugly truths beneath the bonhomie of four friends.\n\nNadirshah\n\nKattapanayile Rithwik Roshan\n\nNadir Shah is the director with the Midas Touch. Both his films, Amar Akbar Antony and Kattapanayile Rithwik Roshan , spun gold at the BO. He knows his audience and that has helped the versatile actor, singer, composer and director win viewers.\n\nVineeth Sreenivasan\n\nJacobinte Swargarajyam\n\nVineeth Sreenivasan, like his father, Sreenivsan, is a multifaceted artiste who has excelled as writer, songster, director and actor.\n\nHis Jacobinte Swargarajyam , a first for him, since it was not based in his comfort zone of Thalassery but in Dubai, proved his credentials as a director.\n\nVineeth turned producer with the blockbuster Aanandam .\n\nJohn Paul George\n\nGuppy\n\nGuppy did not have stars or a beautiful location. But it had a heart-warming storyline and some excellent actors who told us a story of a village; a tale of a mother and a son and a young man who came riding in from the mountains. Guppy \u2019s strength was its actors and a director who had confidence in his work.\n\nVyshakh\n\nPulimurugan\n\nVyshakh has always dreamt big right from his first film.\n\nMany of his films, almost all mass entertainers, have ticked all the right boxes at the box office.\n\nPriyadarsan\n\nOppam\n\nThe only veteran on the list! The king of comedy reminded us once again that he can make dark, slick, thrillers too. Oppam was quite the comeback after years of duds at the BO and it\u2019s reportedly the third highest grossing Malayalam film of all time. Mohanlal as the visually-impaired hero, a lift operator (really, a superman), proved again that he works best with his old buddy.\n\nAbrid Shine\n\nAction Hero Biju gave a makeover to Nivin Pauly\u2019s image and turned him into a no-nonsense cop. The unusual storyline and excellent casting resulted in a realistic take on the life of a police officer. This was Abrid\u2019s second film as director.\n\nGanesh Raj\n\nAanandam\n\nThe new kid on the block has had a real fun outing at the box office. This happy-go-lucky little film, starring seven young newcomers, follows a bunch of engineering students on a fun-filled, song-filled, romance-filled industrial visit (engineering college speak for a study tour). Nivin Pauly\u2019s cameo was a lovely surprise.\n\nSamir C. Thahir\n\nKali\n\nAfter tapping into the new generation\u2019s yen for adventure with road movie Neelakasham Pachakadal Chuvanna Bhoomi , Samir\u2019s much-awaited comeback at the helm perfectly captured the rage of youth today and the unfortunate consequences of letting loose all that anger. Dulquer Salmaan gave a superlative performance as a temperamental youngster and Sai Pallavi as his helpless wife, the calm to his storm.\n\nJude Anthany Joseph\n\nOru Muthassi Gadha\n\nAll eyes were on his second film after his spectacular debut with Ohm Shanti Oshaana . Nivin\u2019s seed of a story was developed into a feature film and only Jude could have done that. They were many, including Nivin who wondered if he could pull off the tale of two grandmothers. But Jude was convinced it was a tale of our times. He introduced a newcomer, 50-plus Rajni Chandy, in the lead role and she became an overnight sensation.\n\nVidhu Vincent\n\nManhole\n\nVidhu Vincent made headlines when her film Manhole got selected for the competition section of the International Film Festival of Kerala, the first woman to do so.

Excerpts\n\nHave you always been so outspoken?\n\nAre you referring to my conversation two minutes ago or to my comments on Twitter?\n\nOn Twitter\n\nTwitter for me is fun. I don\u2019t take it too seriously. I like to make people happy. Most often I am the butt of the joke. I don\u2019t make fun of people. I try not to hurt anyone. If, however, I have hurt anyone, I apologise, I say I am sorry. I have become sceptical about voicing my opinions now and only come out if I see injustice like in the case of my niece\u2019s child.\n\nDon\u2019t they say being outspoken and non-diplomatic in Bollywood is like committing hara-kiri?\n\nNo, this is who I am. Standards are set all the time of what is acceptable and what is not.\n\nDid you always want to become an actor?\n\nAs far as I can remember. I come from a family of actors. We are steeped in it. I am thankful to god that I have been able to carry the legacy forward.\n\nAre you a method actor?\n\nNot at all! I am a spontaneous actor, an instant coffee, instant noodle kind of actor. I respect all schools of acting. When my son wanted to study at Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, I told him it was his call. I believe in this day and age, spontaneity works. All the younger generation are spontaneous actors.\n\nI\u2019ve been told by mimicry artistes that I am a very difficult actor to imitate because I do not have a particular style. In my generation, all the actors had their individual styles, I didn\u2019t. People could imitate my dances because they were choreographed but not my acting. Acting is like riding a bicycle. They say once you learn to ride, even if you haven\u2019t ridden for years, when you get on a bicycle, you might wobble for a bit and then you find your balance. Acting is like that you never lose your craft. There are no good or bad actors, only actors and non-actors.\n\nYou are known to be impatient and short tempered\u2026\n\nYes, but for Kapoor & Sons , I\u2019d sit in a chair for make-up for hours on end. You tell me does that make me patient or impatient? It depends, yes I am irritable and if you ask me to stare at this poster for 15 minutes\n\nI would lose patience. I was willing to put in the time for Kapoor & Sons because of passion. I am a man of the moment. I do not have nerves of steel to quietly take whatever life dishes out.\n\nWhat is it about acting that still excites you after all these years?\n\nI had reached saturation with singing and dancing around trees. I wasn\u2019t enjoying myself. Now I play characters \u2014 good, evil I enjoy them all. I enjoy the process of acting, of reinventing myself.\n\nCould you name some of your memorable performances?\n\nNo, I leave that for others to judge. Good, bad, indifferent, I chose to act in those movies. No one put a gun to my temple and forced me to act. I acted in those films to the best of my capacity. It is my job and I have to do it well. Acting in a film is not a favour, that is what I am paid to do. I tell my son also, you are supposed to be good, you have been paid for it.\n\nWhat does marriage mean to you?\n\nIt is a commitment. Neetu and I played according to the rules we set. I have been accused of not allowing Neetu to act after marriage. That is not true. In a marriage, one person is the breadwinner and the other is a homemaker. In our marriage, I was the breadwinner and I am very lucky Neetu was the homemaker. I know I am a difficult and painful man. Neetu was the shock absorber and I am thankful for that. She has kept me going.\n\nAre you a people person?\n\nI have to be, but I am not overtly friendly, I am not very accessible to fans, I do not seek attention. It is a failing, but that is how I am.\n\nDo you watch films?\n\nOf course I do! Cinema is my second mother.\n\nYou are publishing your autobiography Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored \u2026\n\nI am excited and nervous about it. I have been working on it for three years. It is published by Harper Collins and will be launched at The Hindu Lit for Life 2017. I am looking forward to it. While there have been books on the Kapoors, there has never been one by a Kapoor. There is nothing boring in the book, but don\u2019t look for scandal and sensation in it. I talk about my life, my failures, successes, all facets of films, things I\u2019ve enjoyed.\n\nAre you liberal or conservative?\n\nIt depends on the situation. In certain matters I could be orthodox; in others I could be unorthodox.\n\nI haven\u2019t shot here in the past 20 years and I am saddened that the greenery has been replaced by a concrete jungle but I hope some of the charm still survives.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16962667.ece/BINARY/30bgminrishikap+GKS12A7SI.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Mini Anthikad Chhibber"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/%E2%80%98An-instant-noodle-kind-of-actor%E2%80%99/article16967922.ece", "title": "\u2018An instant noodle kind of actor\u2019"}, {"text": "Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan said that he used to borrow money from his friends and family members as a child to buy comic books.

On August 8, I set off on a solo Harley Davidson Ride, on my Sportster 48, through the length of the country, south to north,- Kanyakumari to Leh- a 6000 km journey and another 1000 km from Leh to New Delhi, in 40 days. I completed the ride on September 29. I am a seafaring man, currently commanding the Volvox Asia. Back on my ship at Mean Sea Level, I think constantly of my once-in-a-lifetime trip that I undertook at the age of 58, before it became too late.\n\nThe adventure has left me a changed person. I think of the things that motivated me and kept me going alone, single, on my bike to areas unknown.\n\nI started from Kochi and went down south to Kanyakumari from where I altered course northwards.\n\nI had a hiccup right in the beginning of my ride, near Ooty, when I had a fall after visiting my school, The Lawrence School. I was injured and the bike was damaged. It was a setback and I lost 10 days. It was also a time when my morale dipped, but I always think of my school motto- Never Give In. That spurred me on.\n\nI went through various landscapes on my bike. However, the beauty and ruggedness of the Himalayas were exceptional and surpassed everything else. The ride from Manali to Leh was very challenging with altitudes starting from 5,000 feet and culminating at 18,380 feet at Khardungla Pass. Rough roads, good roads, no roads, water crossings, rocky roads, slushed roads, cold weather, absolute wilderness I negotiated it all on my mean machine with no support for the bike and no mobile phone connection for three days. Along the way I stayed in hotels, tents, with village folks meeting fellow motorcycle riders on the way.\n\nSome of the highest mountain passes I rode through were Rohtang, Nakeela, Baralachla, Taglangla, Zojila and Khardungla, ranging from 11,000 feet to 18,380 feet. I had carried my company Vanoord\u2019s Flag, The Lawrence School cap and The Spice Coast Harley flag with me all the way to unfurl at the Khardungla top, which I did on September 20.\n\nAfter returning to Leh I decided to go through to Kargil, Drass, Zojila, Sonamarg, Srinagar, Udhampur and Jammu in the Jammu and Kashmir State.\n\nSome of the intense emotions I felt, during the course of the ride, were of pride for our Indian army soldiers. It struck me most when I was at the Kargil-Drass war memorial and the war memorial at Zojila Pass. I tried to trace some of the roads that my father would have built during his tenure in the Army Corps of Engineers\n\nI managed to clear the troubled area and arrived in New Delhi on September 29.\n\nMy sense of achievement comes from the fact that so many deterred me from undertaking the trip saying that it was dangerous; from riding 15 hours to cover 200 km with just a bottle of water and dates on a certain day. There were so many incidents on the way, so many memories, such breathtaking beauty of nature that all I now wish, back in my cabin on sea, to be on the road once again, maybe another set of mountains this time.\n\nArun Varma is Captain of MV Volvox Asia.\n\n( As told to Priyadershini S .)\n\nI think constantly of this once-in-a-lifetime trip that I undertook at the age of 58, before it became too late", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16967917.ece/BINARY/Komp-Arun-Varma+GKS12A7GA.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": [], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/On-road-to-the-summit/article16967919.ece", "title": "On road to the summit"}, {"text": "Whether it was the ubiquitous kurtas or oversized shirts, loose, comfortable clothing was the dominant feature on the ramps and racks this year.\n\nComfort was uppermost in the mind of the coutourist and, of course, the wearer. In fact, comfort clothing was the trend not only on runways but was also found favour in the dream factories of Bollywood. It was about practical clothing as female stars didn\u2019t mind sporting long T-shirts and sweat shirts during film promotion.\n\nLoose clothing has been an international trend and has now percolated to India.\n\nExperts feel, it has a sociological dimension to it.According to seasoned designer Payal Jain, it is freedom to wear clothes in which the wearer feels comfortable. \u201cLoose clothing has a sociological and practical aspect to it because people want comfort. It is no longer about good looks. The reasoning that if you want to look good then you are bound to wear certain kind of clothes is no longer applicable. I will connect this trend with freedom and right to wear garments in which you feel comfortable. Now it is about an expression of individuality and who you are. The practical aspect is that people need to travel lot more now.\u201d\n\nConscious fashion was the norm this year as every designer worth his salt spoke about sustainability, explaining how waste in factory can be minimised.\n\nOversized clothing doesn\u2019t mean oversized bodies. In fact, as more and more girls are spending time in the gym, the demand for a sporty sensibility also increased in fashion. No wonder, the picture of Kalki Koechlin sporting sneakers with sari went viral. Does this mean the grace and femininity that we associate with fashion is waning? Veteran designer Ritu Kumar maintains that in India both can co-exist.\n\nHere are a few trends that made a cut with customers in 2016\n\nShirt dresses\n\nLong shirt dresses with asymmetrical hemlines, quirky cuts and double high slits were in vogue. Similarly, loose shirt were part of anti-fit and they trickled down all the way from runway to street wear. Rather than the usual machine-made shirts, designers gave handloom shirts a new lease of life.\n\n\u201cOversized shirts were certainly the norm this year. It had to do with flexibility that they provide,\u201d says David Abraham.\n\nEmbracing athleisure\n\nSportswear was a big inspiration this year. As sports and gymming is becoming a part of everyday life, Indians are increasingly embracing athleisure to show off their toned bodies. With the complex of hiding that girth waning, sportswear is increasingly finding expression n fashion ateliers. Designers are draping a person in gym wear that works well outside workout arena. Every designer used it in styling like loose shirt with skirts, gold sneakers with long kurtas or tunics.\n\n\u201cSportswear can easily blend with tunics or worn with kurtas. It has percolated from runway to streetwear,\u201d says Shalini James.\n\nSari returns\n\nGood old saris were presented in new avatars in fashion weeks where they look more like a gown.\n\nThe novelty factor in 2016 was that saris were also also presented in classical ways during fashion weeks. And it was given a fillip by not only heavyweights like Sabyasachi Mukherjee, JJ Valaya and Rohit Bal but also emerging names like Gaurang Shah and Shalini James.\n\n\u201cThis year saris were a fashion stable. Even in classical hues, saris retained their charm,\u201d notes Shalini James.\n\nAnd this was reflected in the way young girls are going in for Banarasi or Chanderi saris.\n\nOff-shoulder dresses\n\nOff shoulder tops have been much sought after from runways to malls. Office goers, particularly those in hospitality and corporate sector, have been flaunting them as they are pleasant to the eye and also make the wearer feel comfortable during sweltering summers. Moreover, it can go as a style statement in evening cocktail parties.\n\nExplaining its popularity, Anupama Dayal says: \u201cFirstly, off shoulder tops go with our kind of climate. Secondly, revealing collar bone is the easiest way for Indian women to look sensuous without compromising on grace \u201d\n\nPyjama-crazy\n\nPyjama came out of bedrooms to runways. With comfort being paramount in wearer\u2019s mind, pyjamas in blue and violet grabbed lot of eyeballs in fashion weeks. Light, easy to wear, they are breathable fabric, which provide comfort in hot sticky weather.\n\nJust like Spain\u2019s palazzo and Pakistan\u2019s salwar are sought after , the Indian pyjama has global acceptance.\n\n\u201cPyjama-craze is not going to die down as it would come in the form of asymmetrical pyjama next year. It is supremely comfortable and the easiest thing to wear,\u201d says Anupama.\n\nI will connect this trend with freedom to wear garments in which you feel comfortablePayal Jain", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16962907.ece/BINARY/29dmctrend.ART_+G39125F18.15.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Madhur Tankha"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Size-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter-Or-does-it/article16967921.ece", "title": "Size doesn\u2019t matter!

Metallic lip colours look especially good when added to the centre of your lip. After you apply your regular lipstick, use a metallic liquid lipstick right at the centre and blend it into your base lipstick gently. This gives dimension and interest to a bold lip.\n\nIf you want to take it one step further, the glitter lip is for you. Make sure you have a make-up remover handy, because it can get a bit messy. Start with lining your lips and filling it with lipstick; a more glossy lipstick with opaque colour payoff is key. It will ensure that the glitter adheres to it. Once you have applied your lipstick, pick out your favourite glitter pigment and dab carefully within the lines of your lips, with a brush of your ring finger.\n\nChrome and holographic nails\n\nProbably, the most social media-friendly trend of 2016 has to be the almost mirror-like chrome or holographic nails. While you could always get a super-metallic nail polish that would work great for parties, this particular manicure looks almost magical. It involves buffing holographic pigment over painted nails and then letting them set in an LED nail drier for longevity. While this may seem like a lot of effort for your nails, the result is always spectacular and something everyone must try at least once.\n\nMetallic eyes\n\nDo you sense a theme yet? Highly-pigmented, opaque, super-metallic and almost wet-looking eyeshadow is a definite must-have this party season. Foiled eyeshadows, or pigments and sparkles, can all be used to achieve this very popular look. To give your eyes even more dimension, use a lighter, more metallic colour in the centre of your lids to really make them look wet. You can also ditch the mattes and go in for fully-metallic smoky eyes, which would make a great statement with a matte lip. You could also try your regular eyeshadows for this look, using a product such as Too Faced Glitter Glue or MAC\u2019s Fix +.\n\nGraphic eyeliner\n\nEyeliner has been around for ages, and with every season, much like everything else, something new comes along. This season, the graphic eyeliner is back, making more heads turn than ever. There isn\u2019t any right or wrong in this. It\u2019s about having fun, creating a gap in your regular feline flick, or just drawing a simple line on the water line and nothing else; it\u2019s about the stark contrast of bare skin and something a little bit out of the ordinary. Personally, graphic liner paired with a statement lip and nude skin would be my perfect holiday look, this year.\n\nStatement ponytails\n\nOf course, with all these make-up options, we can\u2019t leave out hair, now, can we?\n\nOf all the hairstyles that adorned the runways and red carpets, the sleek, glossy pulled-back high ponytail was my favourite. Not only does a high ponytail suit most faces, it makes your life so much easier. Your hair could be greasy and unwashed, but you can still pull this off with minimum effort. Straighten the ends of your hair, so it looks neat and polished. Using products on your roots to comb and pull back your hair into a ponytail ensures that it looks sleek even after a long night of dancing and sweating. Once done, spray it with hairspray for extra grit and longevity.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/article16935440.ece/BINARY/24mp_shru--2-.A+G3E11EVN4.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Shrutilaya Ramanathan"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/Best-of-2016/article16967911.ece", "title": "Best of 2016"}, {"text": "Last week's answer: Karun Nair\n\nA.

Right from the tsunami in 2004 to this year\u2019s cyclone Vardah, the city has endured many large-scale calamities.\n\nOne may think that natural calamities have a lasting impact on the real estate sector, but the truth is that in the long run, it has little or no bearing.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tsunami, many had expected prices along the coastal corridors of the city to take a hit, but it never happened. Micro markets along Chennai\u2019s coastline such as the East Coast Road, Besant Nagar, and MRC Nagar had been on the front-line, and experts anticipated that buyers would stay away from these markets entirely. But in the last decade they have witnessed tremendous growth and are amongst the most expensive residential localities in the city today. For instance MRC Nagar, which occupies a good chunk of Chennai\u2019s coastline, has seen an astronomical price appreciation of 60 per cent year-on-year in the past decade. An apartment in MRC Nagar which was selling at Rs. 3,000 to 4,000 per sq.ft. a decade ago, is priced at Rs. 18000 to 20,000 a sq.ft. today.\n\nEven an apartment in Besant Nagar ranges between Rs. 14,0000 and Rs. 17,000 a sq.ft.\n\nAnother example of property prices remaining stable after a natural disaster is the one-year period between the floods of December 2015 until today.

It helps citizens meet their travel needs in an economical, safe, and energy-efficient manner. However, cities in India have not invested adequately in developing good quality public transport systems. Only 63 of the 458 Indian cities with more than 1,00,000 inhabitants have a formal city bus system. Within this, 15 cities also have a bus or rail based mass rapid transit system. Even where cities have formal public transport systems, the level of investment support is limited to intermittent efforts in augmenting capacities and covering funding backlogs of bus operators. Many cities lack sustained institutional and financial support to strengthen their bus systems.\n\nAs a result, most cities have witnessed a deterioration in the capacity and quality of their bus services. Such inadequacies are being partially addressed by informal Intermediate Public Transport (IPT) services like taxis, informal shared auto-rickshaws providing shuttle services, school buses, and chartered bus services.\n\nAt the same time, cities continue to build wider roads, flyovers and expressways. This has provided short-term relief from congestion. But on the flip side, they induce people to use private modes like cars and two-wheelers, which leads to more congestion, fuel consumption and air pollution.\n\nClearly, more cars on the road are not a sustainable solution in the long run. A better opportunity is to build better and high quality public transport services that meet India\u2019s developmental and environmental objectives. Given their low costs per passenger, flexibility in operations and ease in implementation, bus systems provide the best solution for India to scale up public transport systems across all cities. In line with this assessment, the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, in partnership with Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit Systems (DIMTS), recently carried out a comprehensive review of the existing performance of bus systems in India to understand their current drawbacks and identify a roadmap for their improvement.\n\nThe study covers city bus systems in 12 cities of varying population sizes, geographic locations and level of progressiveness of bus systems. Data regarding the operational and financial characteristics of these bus systems has been analysed to understand their comparative performance. The study also carried out detailed interactions with the senior management of these organisations to identify the existing gaps in their practices and the key barriers faced in addressing them.\n\nThe key gaps identified in the operations, planning, and management of the bus systems are classified into six key areas: Strategic planning, supporting infrastructure, financing, use of technology, operational efficiency, and institutional frameworks. The lack of long-term strategic planning and adequate financing is observed as a key gap area across all the cities. As a result, all the cities are observed to have a shortage in the bus fleet required to meet their mobility needs. On the remaining categories, cities are observed to be at varying levels of efficiency.\n\nWhile cities like Bengaluru and Ahmedabad are working towards installing state of the art Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) to improve their services, cities like Kanpur and Raipur are struggling to put all their buses in operation due to lack of adequate staff for management. The institutional framework within which the buses operate has an impact on their operations. The city buses managed as a part of the State Road Transport Undertakings (STU) are given a lower priority compared to the STUs\u2019 inter-city operations. At the same time, the city buses managed by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) created specifically for city operations suffer from a shortage in technical and financial capacity to manage bus systems.\n\nAdditionally, specific gaps in issues like Management Information Systems (MIS), fleet and crew management, human resources, fare mechanisms and data analytics of each of the cities have also been identified.\n\nThe study has developed a roadmap to address these gaps. This includes short, medium, and long term measures that are needed to revitalise bus systems in Indian cities. The short to medium term recommendations provided to the cities involve specific solutions to address the existing gaps through adoption of national and international best practices. The long-term solutions will need a more comprehensive approach that covers all aspects of planning, operations and management of city bus systems. Therefore, the development of a long-term vision and a business plan to achieve it is recommended to be taken up by all bus operating agencies.\n\nIn addition to the improvements needed by the bus operators, the enabling policy and regulatory reforms to be taken up by the concerned national, state and city-level government authorities have been identified.\n\nThe report has also identified various areas of intervention where leadership and innovations can be sourced from independent think tanks, research groups and start-ups working on the subject. Improving city bus systems is a key enabler in achieving the urban development vision of India and will need sustained institutional and political support at various levels of governance.\n\nThe full report can be downloaded at the following link: http://shaktifoundation.in/\n\ninitiative/roadmap-\n\nimproving-city-bus-systems-\n\nindia/.\n\nThe authors are part of the Transport Program at the New Delhi-based Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article16968063.ece/BINARY/17PP_Shakti-Fou+GFE108JTB.9.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Ravi Gadepalli"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/How-to-improve-city-bus-systems/article16968064.ece", "title": "How to improve city bus systems"}, {"text": "If your home hasn\u2019t been home sweet home these days, perhaps it\u2019s time for a change.

A recipient of the Padma Shri award for his environment sensitive work, Shankar\u2019s designs are totally tuned to earth, the structures using mud blocks, rammed earth, and filler slab roofs along with salvaged materials wherever possible. The social architect that he is, the language of his design and construction techniques is strongly low cost and environment responsive.\n\nShankar believes in getting his hands soiled, where he can physically feel the earth, discover the versatility of various materials by physically experiencing them. His designs exude simplicity yet a masterly handling of the spaces, the volumes and angles expertly done, revealing an intuitive as well as a master\u2019s touch. While mud is certainly versatile, it has its own inherent drawbacks. Hence why the obsession with it as the predominant material in his structures?\n\n\u201cMud certainly has its own challenges such as being attacked by termites and losing strength if drenched, yet these can be worked around. Mud has fascinating features, the vocabulary of the material being so sensuous as it is easily mouldable even with bare hands. You need to physically experience it to understand its innate strength. In terms of visual appeal the multiple colours and textures it offers can be irresistible\u201d, he says. \u201cMud has its own inherent tensile strength but there is no proper documentation of the technique of using it\u201d, he laments.\n\nHaving been inspired as a young architect by the unconventional structures and designs of Laurie Baker, Shankar moved on to reflect this source of inspiration in all his designs and manner of construction. His first project, executed three decades ago, was completed at an unbelievable cost of Rs. 11,000, using low cost construction techniques. A significant part of his work continues to be large scale social housing where low cost construction techniques have been employed. His social projects have brought him many awards that include the UNDP award for the best post-tsunami rehabilitation work in India besides the national award for the Best Eco City design in 2015.\n\nNo columns\n\nWhen invited to execute a project in Dhaka, Shankar came up with an earth building which incidentally is the largest of its kind in the world. The six-storey load bearing mud structure spanning six lakh sq. ft displays a total absence of columns. \u201cWe used locally available mud in construction and the pale yellow clay that was used for mud plaster offers a beautiful, differential hue to the building\u201d, says Shankar. \u201cThe region gets eight to nine months of heavy rains, yet the mud structure has been standing strong for the last 10 years\u201d, he smiles.\n\nHis residence, built totally in mud, is yet another fine example of the versatility of mud and low cost construction techniques. Fluid in design and planning of spaces, the mud blocks and rammed earth structure standing at two levels flows magnificently, the smooth curves, mud vaulted roofs, strategic vents and punctures letting copious natural light and ventilation into the interiors. \u201cThe mud blocks have been used without a binding material, by opting for the inter-locking system\u201d, explains Shankar.\n\nIt is common to assume that low cost techniques would offer a dowdy ambience. \u201cThis is nothing but a myth\u201d, says Shankar. He points to a residential project where such techniques were opted for. Built on a cramped site that had an uneven gradient, the design was structured to lend an expansive feel by making it free flowing. The spaces are multi-levelled, where the functional spaces are deftly demarcated.\n\nAesthetics\n\nA rock prevailing in the site is retained, the interiors designed craftily around it. The aesthetics of the structure and interiors reflects no connection with the low cost building techniques adopted.\n\nShankar\u2019s office reflects similar techniques.\n\nBuilt on a narrow strip of land with a sharp gradient that is 30 ft. higher on one end, the multi-level spaces reflect a mastery of strokes that handles the constraints of the site while adopting the use of mud blocks, rammed earth and mud plaster with its mud texture to erect a structure sans the conventional columns.\n\n\u201cThis is the strength of mud,\u201d smiles Shankar.\n\n\u2018Mud has its own inherent tensile strength but there is no proper documentation of the technique of using it.\u2019", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article16968077.ece/BINARY/31bgp-shankar-l+GPV12BOP2.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Nandhini Sundar"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/Building-%E2%80%98mouldable%E2%80%99-houses/article16968079.ece", "title": "Building \u2018mouldable\u2019 houses"}, {"text": "Everyone is talking money \u2013 demonetisation, political agenda, cash crunch, hoarding new currency, impacts on daily life, IT raids, eradicating black money and hoping for a white future. Rich and poor people alike are finding the daily needs hard to come by with little money in hand, irrespective of how much they have in bank balance or in old currency. We all know there is less money in market; hence business is not as usual.\n\nWhile so much has been spoken and written about the impact of demonetisation on varied facets of life, hardly anyone has touched upon its impact on ecology and resources. It is strange but true that cash crunch is beneficial to nature.\n\nOn a few fronts, the present cash crunch is comparable to the economic recession of the recent past, faced mainly in the west, with some implications for India too. People faced reducing income, challenge of loan repayments, increased unsold inventories, money getting blocked and financial uncertainties looming large. Between all the social tension it created, one of the benefits was reduced consumption, hence earth resources saved, energy used efficiently and wastage reduced.\n\nOn a similar note, the recent demonetisation in the country has impacted larger issues of ecology positively. With no ready cash to spend, people have been buying and spending less, of course impacting on everything from tourism to rituals. Incidentally, lesser business does not necessarily mean shops and restaurants are facing losses. They earn less, in turn spend less hoping to extend the new currency they got for as long as they can.\n\nOf course, many people living on daily wages are suffering, for they are already living on minimum daily income and cannot manage with further reduced cash inflow.\n\nMoney and materialistic lifestyle are directly proportional, where our lifestyle demands that we earn more money. In turn, income meets the expenditure, increasing production. People earning well may appear to have larger sums with them compared to the rest with lower incomes, but their monthly savings in percentage figure could be often comparable.\n\nThis suggests that higher income group spends more, while those with lower income spend less, each spending proportional to their income categories.\n\nA paradox\n\nAs such, it is a paradox where money and market fuel each other, which together increase the consumption patterns.\n\nWe know that increased consumption is good for economy, but ecologically it is disastrous, irrespective of whether the consumption is for our present needs, future savings or mere personal greed. The rich may have the financial affordability to spend, but our fragile Earth cannot afford to take anymore of our wasteful life.\n\nSo, if the present crisis due to demonetisation has reduced our shopping, travelling, holidaying, partying, conferencing, manufacturing, in general spending, it has reduced the consumption of resources.\n\nIt could be temporary, until the money flow restores again; yet it is beneficial to nature. Can we ensure this benefit lasts long enough to save the climate?\n\n(The writer is an architect working for eco-friendly designs and can be contacted at varanashi@gmail.com)", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article16968069.ece/BINARY/31bgpgreensense+G9U12731P.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Sathya Prakash Varanashi"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/Some-respite-for-the-environment/article16968070.ece", "title": "Some respite for the environment?"}, {"text": "In India\u2019s highly dynamic market environment, change and innovation have become essential for the survival of any business. The housing sector has been no exception. Let us examine five factors that stand out in this respect:\n\n1. Increasing focus on affordable ticket sizes\n\nAcross most Indian cities, the financial \u2018sweet spot\u2019 for home buyers is seen to be in the range of Rs. 50-70 lakh. In hyper-expensive Mumbai, ticket sizes of around Rs. 1 crore are popular with buyers because of the higher wealth creation and therefore purchasing power there. However, as of 3Q16, there has been a rise in apartments priced under Rs. 1 crore in Mumbai, as well.\n\nThe proportion of increase in units launched in Mumbai in the under Rs. 1 crore ticket size increased more than the proportion of the overall rise in unit launches.\n\nMumbai serves as a good example to illustrate the rising affordability trend because it is the toughest market in the country, and yet could see more launches in this segment. Other cities will, therefore, fare even better than Mumbai in terms of decreasing housing ticket sizes.\n\nTo keep the price tags of their offerings attractive, developers have been reducing the average carpet area of apartments across cities. For example, the average apartment sizes in Mumbai and Bengaluru have, in recent years, shrunk by 12 per cent and 30 per cent respectively .\n\n2. Configurations revolution\n\nWhen it comes to the most preferred configurations, 1-BHK flats remain the most popular in Mumbai, while 2-BHKs rule in most other cities such as Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad.\n\nOf course, affordability is the main reason behind the popularity of smaller flats in Mumbai. Most of these smaller configurations are priced around Rs. 1 crore, which is considered \u2018affordable\u2019 by Mumbai standards.\n\nMoreover, selling these units later on is easier than selling bigger configurations, as there are always more people looking to buy 1-BHK flats in Mumbai than there are units available. In other cities, the same logic applies to the 2-BHK configuration. As real estate in most cities is cheaper than in Mumbai, home buyers can afford to and do buy bigger configurations.\n\n3. More developers entering affordable segment\n\nThe Modi government\u2019s focus on affordable housing has helped in making this segment more palatable to developers. The erstwhile aversion to being tagged as \u2018low-income housing builder\u2019 has waned, and even larger players are openly entering this market segment.\n\nAfter the recent demonetisation move, land prices will plummet - more so in the tier-II, III cities and the fringe areas of metros.\n\nThis, too, will aid the cause of making homes more affordable in India. While developers are already constructing smaller-sized units on the outskirts of cities, the government must step in by improving the connectivity of these outskirts to respective city centres.\n\n4. Basic amenities\n\nHome buyers expect decent amenities in their housing projects, regardless of whether they are townships or standalone buildings. While townships offer many amenities, sufficient parking, a small garden and play area, good security and power backup are now increasingly being seen even in standalone residential buildings.\n\nBuyers are no longer willing to settle for amenities-starved projects and expect the basic facilities even if their purchasing power is on the lower side.\n\nWith more and more developers of modest-sized residential projects heeding this demand, the rest have been left with no choice but to follow suit.\n\n5. Social media\n\nDissatisfied home buyers have been using social media effectively to demand redress of their grievances.\n\nDevelopers have realised the power of social media in brand image management, and many have started responding to buyers\u2019 posts or queries in real time.\n\nAt the same time, they have realised the potential of targeting possible buyers with advertisements while they are online.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article16935858.ece/BINARY/JLL-Trends.ART_+GQ411JPFJ.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["Anuj Puri"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/Trends-shaping-residential-realty/article16968071.ece", "title": "Trends shaping residential realty"}, {"text": "As the year draws to a close it is time to take a quick stock of the way we dealt with water and what opportunities lie in the future. The monsoon State of Kerala, famous for its torrential rains, is reeling under drought. The next six months promise to be tough and emergency plans to manage the drought are being put in place.\n\nIn the Cauvery basin too the rainfall was abysmal. The south-west monsoon failed and the north-east played truant . The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu reached a fever pitch. Even the Supreme Court found it tough to maintain a sense of peace and proportion in the matter.\n\nOnce again the dams of the Cauvery are broadly empty and a long, hot summer awaits. The city of Bengaluru is on the edge of a precipice for meeting its water needs.\n\nOn the other hand the very city did something with waste-water which caught the international media\u2019s attention. Lakes started to foam and even caught fire, filled as they were with untreated sewage and industrial effluents.\n\nFizz over?\n\nWhile citizens\u2019 action, aided by courts, ramped up, the legislature panel identifying encroachments of water bodies and the waterways connecting them is yet to come out with its report.\n\nSporadic actions to clean the waterways by demolishing buildings have stopped and it looks like the fizz in the bottle is over.\n\nAt the national level, the flagship Swachch Bharat Abhiyan and the Clean Ganga movement have rolled along. The former fast becoming a toilet construction programme and the latter, struggling in finding an approach to clean the holy and mighty river.\n\nThe other rivers of India of course are mere water sources to be dammed and exploited and then to dump raw waste-water in.\n\nOur lack of connect and empathy with our water bodies is fast reaching a point of no return, if it has not so already. Sporadic individual and community efforts, howsoever heroic, have not been woven into a large fabric of redemption. We putter along somehow believing that things can be managed.\n\nWe hope that in 2017 we will get our governance and institutions right.\n\nWe simply have lacked the imagination to create the right architecture, capacitated, empowered , responsible and transparent to engage in looking at the big picture and driving coordinated small action towards satisfactory solutions.\n\nFor example, can the state set up at least one river basin institution and one river flowing, clean and free to reach the sea? Can we not create or resuscitate the institution called the JSYS to rejuvenate all our tanks ? How about reviving our traditional water tanks and wells? The district of Bidar showed the way. Will it be sustained and spread to other districts?\n\nOne must conserve water, harvest rainwater, recycle waste-water and one must also engage in community actions such as reviving lakes and streams. One must also pressure the government to get its act right and quickly. Otherwise the deck chairs of the Titanic can be rearranged beautifully but the iceberg approaches.\n\nHere is wishing good action for good rains, good streams, good rivers, good wells, good wetlands and good forests for a waterwise world.\n\nS.Vishwanath", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/article16968080.ece/BINARY/31bgp-waterwise+G9U12731O.3.jpg.jpg", "authors": ["S Vishwanath"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/The-water-saga/article16968081.ece", "title": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, {"text": "The last quarter of 2016 has been a major slowdown for most sectors, with real estate taking the biggest blow. With the introduction of several policies and reforms, the government has stirred up the economy, causing waves of change across the nation. As we sign off today, here\u2019s a quick look at 2016 and its effect on 2017.\n\nEconomic Outlook 2016\n\nIndia recorded Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 7.3% between July-September, 2016, with sectors such as Manufacturing, Public Administration, Defence, Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate being the main growth drivers. The inflation rate (Consumer Price Index) decline continued, reducing from 5.69% in January to 4.2% by November; and was primarily due to ease in food inflation.\n\nWe also witnessed increased FDI or foreign direct investment of up to $ 32,181 million, a rise of 21% in comparison to the same period in 2015. The FDI in real estate was recorded at $ 141 million, a 7% growth since last year.\n\nPlethora of\n\npolicy changes\n\nThe government announced a number of policy initiatives in 2016. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 was passed, to protect the interest of home buyers and bring transparency to the sector, thereby also increasing funding/financing opportunities for all.\n\nThe government also redefined the EWS and LIG qualifying parameters from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh and from Rs.3 lakh to Rs.6 lakh. \u201cHousing for all by 2022\u201d mission was introduced, wherein 305 cities and towns were identified across the nation for construction of affordable houses.\n\nThe mission enables buyers to get subvention scheme loans (end user or buyer is lent money) from banks at a mere 6.5% interest rate while the state/union territory concerned is tasked with fixing the upper ceiling on the sale price The buyer could get up to 90% loan to value ratio on home loans up to Rs. 30 lakh. An additional interest deduction of Rs. 50,000 per annum was available for first time home buyers for loans up to Rs. 35 lakh provided the house cost does not exceed Rs.50 lakh.\n\nThe scheme not only benefits the buyer but also the developers, as they get 100% deduction of tax from profits subject to certain conditions, along with exemption of service tax on materials, services and construction of affordable houses up to 60 sq. m under any scheme of the Central or State government including PPP schemes.\n\nThe government also passed the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016, to identify benami transactions and prohibit them in future. Violation of the Act is punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years and fine. It prohibits the real owner from recovering the property that is held in another person\u2019s name on paper while it gets confiscated by the government without any compensation to the violators.\n\nWhile New Delhi and Mumbai market may observe corrections in the total number of transactions up to 30% across all sectors, markets like Bengaluru will see correction of 15-20%.\n\nHere\u2019s taking a closer looking at the Bengaluru real estate market in 2016.\n\nOffice space\n\nThe absorption rate of office spaces remained vibrant across 2016. Although there were limited supply infusions that led to reduction in the vacancy levels, new developments saw completion. during the year comprising of pre-committed supply. There was a heavy spike in rentals due to lower vacancy levels on Outer Ring Road. Bangalore North witnessed quite a few major developments with availability of space.\n\nRetail\n\nIn 2016, only one mall became operational in the city. The World GT Mall (0.3 million sq. ft) and RMZ Galleria (0.45 million sq. ft) are currently under construction and are expected to get completed by Q1 2017. Leasing activities continued in both high street and mall developments, with stable rentals.\n\nResidential\n\nThere were several new launches across the city, mostly apartments under Rs. 50 lakh price bracket. There was a significant downfall in the luxury housing segment, while demand was high for properties worth less than Rs. 1 crore. The capital values for completed as well as under-construction projects continued to remain stable, thus there was no significant shift/change in the micro-location prices.\n\nA look at the\n\nupcoming year\n\nAs per a International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast, India\u2019s GDP growth is projected at 7.6% for 2016 and 2017. The impact of demonetisation & relaxation in FDI regulations along with increased incentives for affordable housing will likely unfold by the next three to four quarters.\n\nThe Outer Ring Road is likely to witness shortage of space as most under-construction projects are pre-committed. Bangalore North, with significant new office completions, as a consequence, will witness more traction. Softening of demand in Whitefield is likely on account of the upcoming metro rail work.\n\nOn the residential front, new launches are likely to remain conservative. This is mainly attributed to the recent policies/restrictions, high levels of unsold inventory as well as high price points.\n\nThe demand for the less than Rs. 1 crore segment is likely to strengthen on account of continued lowering in home loan interest rates, thereby increasing the affordability factor. Capital values are, however, expected to remain stable as per current levels and the main deciding variable will be the unit sizes. Developers are likely to offer higher number of units with smaller dimensions to capitalise on demand.\n\nOn the retail front, retailers are exhibiting cautiousness with regard to their future expansion plans; and are likely to remain in status quo in the upcoming quarters.\n\nWe will most likely witness retail expansion in the food & beverage segment.\n\nWith all these recent reforms, policy changes and demonetisation drive, transformation of RE sector is afoot and , 2017 will be a \u2018Year of Hope' for buyers as well as developers.\n\nThe sector will witness minimization of risks, boost in buyers\u2019 confidence, and encourage overall transparency & accountability.\n\nShrinivas Rao\n\nThe impact of demonetisation & relaxation in FDI regulations is likely to unfold by the next three to four quarters.", "image": "http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg", "authors": ["Shrinivas Rao"], "link": "http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-propertyplus/A-mixed-bag-for-real-estate/article16968068.ece", "title": "A mixed bag for real estate"}, {"text": "The city of Bhopal , the capital of Madhya Pradesh , is spick and span for now.

Here are fountains and oarsmen practising rowing. In the evening a beautiful sight.\n\nThe larger lake, the Bada Talab, is reputedly a 1000-year-old man-made one. Built by Raja Bhoj, the funder of Bhopal, it is a magnificent 32 sq. km water-spread and the eye cannot see the end of the lake.\n\nHere too from the boating club, boats can be hired and time spent on the water A small island hosts the \u2018dargah\u2019 or tomb of a Sufi saint. Birds fill the trees here, roosting at night.\n\nConstant endeavour\n\nThe city of Bhopal has been blessed with this water and depends to an extent on it for its daily requirements. A project funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Assistance has helped improve the shoreline, develop a park and a walking track all along, divert sewage and prevent flooding by strengthening the embankment.\n\nThe project is now over, yet maintaining an urban lake is not a project but a constant endeavour calling for eternal vigilance.\n\nAs ones walk around the smaller lake one notices a small channel brining raw sewage into it.\n\nThe waters in the small patch have eutrophied and a smell hangs in the air.\n\nQuick action is called for but are the citizens vigilant and have they a good rapport with the authorities ?\n\nThe large lake dried up twice, in 2002 and 2008, says the young man who is rowing me to the tomb of the Sufi saint. Is the catchment being managed well enough, is debris being dumped in the channels which lead to the lake, is a catchment management system in place with the right institution created for it ?\n\nAgain, it is community interaction which will play a crucial role in preserving this functional heritage.\n\nStep-wells\n\nOne searches for Baolis or step-wells in old Bhopal. Of the four that one could ask for to see, two have completely disappeared.\n\nFilled by land sharks and over one, a tower has been built.\n\nOf the remaining two, water was being pumped from one till a couple of months ago till the pump broke down.\n\nIt has not been repaired nor is the step-well clean. Unless a partnership is struck with the neighbouring community , it is unlikely that the well will be maintained and may meet the fate of the other two.\n\nThe last Baoli is under the ASI and they are doing their best to repair and rehabilitate a magnificent structure, still full of water.\n\nIt would have been best if these four and more step-wells had been brought back to life as living and functional heritage, supplying water to the locality yet being showcased for the tourists who would inevitably come to see them bolstering the local economy rather than being an archaeological preserve.\n\nThe Mayor of Bhopal is a dynamic personality, interested very much in keeping alive the magnificence of a city just entering a phase of rapid urbanisation.\n\nWith committed citizen groups working with the local government it is possible to become water secure, climate resilient, preserve heritage and be water sufficient .\n\nGoing local is truly the path to water wisdom.
